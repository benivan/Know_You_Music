    "description": "Although for most people Heavy Metal is (correctly) a harder and faster type of Rock, the genre is actually a continuation of “the Devil’s music”: Blues. After Metal’s experimental phase during the seventies (read more at Classic Metal), it lost a lot of its Blues influences and evolved rapidly into a variety of different styles. Two aspects of Blues have always remained however: lyrics about sorrow, nihilism, pain, tragedy, and a more concealed subtext revolving the Devil (though for Blues this was more a reputation than an actual theme). Heavy Metal expanded on these aspects in an obsessive manner. Death, destruction, corpses, zombies, Satan, pentagrams, evil themes, lots of black, torture, sharp and gothic artwork, and a hand symbol that both resembles the Devil’s horns and the letter “M”. These are the main elements of stereotypical Metal artwork/culture that have become so dominant that anything else is almost an exception to the rule. The visual language of Metal – a symbolism of anything dark or evil – transcends into corresponding fashion: black T-shirts with Metal artwork, black leather, wristbands with sharp pins, long sleazy hair, black jeans and of course: metal.<br><br>The term “Heavy Metal” describes well the two cornerstone aspects of the genre. It is heavy due to more amplification and distortion than Rock and it is also very “metallic”, meaning technical/rational. Heavy Metal is an overcharged engineer among genres, with highly technical unique elements such as blast beats, double bass drums, 12 string bass, lightning guitar solos and difficult voice techniques (grunting, falsetto, opera, screeching, etc.). Heavy Metal songs are usually longer than Rock songs, with more elaborate and diverse song structures. Without a radio friendly format, Metal has stayed clear from mainstream attention, although the genre is internationally well-known and connects fans across the most diverse of countries. Riffs are even more important than in Rock, and form the foundation around which many Metal songs are built. Many Metal riffs, especially early ones, make use of the Tritone: a musical dissonant interval of three whole tones that conveys a sense of restlessness.  As such, the Tritone used to be associated with the Devil (Tritonus Diabolus in Musica Est) since the 18th century. What makes Metal appealing as well is a strong tendency for the theatrical. Metal likes to be bombastic to fortify its message (often of doom or evil), whether by classical elements, synth elements, more instrumentation, instrumental intermezzos, or elaborate intros.<br><br>“Heavy Metal” as a phrase can be traced back to Steppenwolf’s famous Hard Rock single “Born to be Wild”, in which the line “Heavy Metal Thunder” is mentioned: a quote from William S. Burrough’s book “Naked Lunch”. After all, Heavy Metal and Hard Rock were more or less the same in the early stages of the genre.<br><br>Heavy Metal is extremely popular within nerd culture. This is no coincidence: Metal is music for the analytical mind; it does not simply present itself but challenges the listener to carefully dissect the overload of mid- and low-frequency aural information. In order to absorb all of the music, Metal urges to re-listen at high volume. Because nerd culture has taken an interest in Metal, it has become one of the most defined, examined and structured super-genres, with a strong hierarchical genealogy and copious (over 50) subgenres, sometimes bordering on the ludicrous. Christian Black Metal, Pirate Metal and Viking Metal are such examples. It is only a matter of time before Ninja Metal gets invented, but until then, there is already plenty to explore within one of the healthiest super-genres and with one of the most loyal fan bases. Metal has considerable overlapping with Hardcore Punk, as both genres share a love for speed and heavy guitar music. Grunge is sometimes regarded as a part of Metal as well, but this has led to a backlash of German Metal fans, who swear only by so called “True Metal”: Metal without Grunge or other crossovers.<br><br>Although Metal culture is (just like Hardcore Punk) largely drug-free, the average alcohol consumption tends to be much higher than within any other music culture and certain genres (Folk Metal or Viking Metal) are conceived as the perfect music to be very, very drunk to. Combined with the special Metal “dance” of head-banging, Metal is far from an introvert genre – it’s meant to bring down the house.",

        "description": "Heavy Metal used to be an interchangeable term with Hard Rock in the late sixties. The earliest examples of the genre - Classic (Heavy) Metal - are often cited as Hard Rock examples and vice versa. As such, Classic Metal is a <b>loosely defined</b> genre: simply “<b>Harder-than-Hard Rock</b>”, mainly by means of <b>more amplification and distortion</b>. However, two British bands marked a turning point after which the schism with Rock was a fact:<b> Black Sabbath</b> and <b>Led Zeppelin</b>.<br><br>The shocking <b>tragedy</b> of four deaths and excessive violence at the <b>Altamont Festival</b> in <b>1969</b> marked the end of the flower power age, a temporary exile of the Rolling Stones and most importantly: a <b>loss of belief in the hippy utopia</b>. Rock couldn’t make the world a better place and everyone had witnessed the <b>dark side of human nature</b>: deep down inside man is evil. The first band to be influenced by this event was Led Zeppelin. Described at the time as Rock music being dark, <b>heavy and gloomy</b>, it was almost impossible to listen to. Black Sabbath developed an even <b>slower, tuned-down sound</b>, yet also full of distortion, with <b>thick and heavy riffs</b>. In their later work they also experimented with tempo and different instrumentation. Both bands feature <b>lengthy songs</b>, with <b>elaborate guitar solos</b>, while often referring to <b>satanic or dark themes</b>.<br><br>These early blueprints inspired Blues Rock and Acid Rock artists into a similar sound and style, yet over the course of time Blues influences became replaced by a <b>pure metallic sound</b>.",

        "description": "What the NWOBHM did to Classic Metal, Thrash Metal did to the NWOBHM. American bands became hugely influenced by their British predecessors and decided to take it up another notch: the music became <b>even faster</b> and more drum and bass heavy (often involving a drum kit with <b>two bass drums</b>). Glam/Pop Metal made Metal too commercial and lighthearted. Thrash Metal was the answer. Besides <b>aggressive, low-frequency riffs</b> (which are sometimes fittingly described as “<b>shredding</b>”), hyperactive scales and arpeggios and prominent <b>thrashing drum work</b> are the most recognizable features of Thrash Metal. The overall song length also increases compared to NWOBHM, adding <b>more complex song structures </b>to the music. The genre quickly stood out amongst other Metal styles and soon a number of bands rose to <b>international fame</b>, known as the “<b>Big Four of Thrash Metal</b>”. These Bands - Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax - helped spread Metal throughout the globe, from Japan to Brazil. Thrash Metal also displays a less friendly form of lyrical content. With <b>nihilistic lyrics</b>, often about <b>anti-establishment, justice or war</b>, Metal bands use just about anything to enforce a theatrical vocabulary. But like almost all Heavy Metal the message is rather cryptic than truly political.  By the nineties, Thrash Metal’s popularity faded and a new subgenre “<b>Groove Metal</b>” (aka Groove Rock) came in to light. Groove Metal or Rock focused more on a rhythmic groove than simply bass. Yet Thrash Metal is still among the most widely known Metal genres and like any <b>golden age</b>, never truly dead.",

Not all songs by Doom Metal bands are strictly Doom, some are quite fast and simply Heavy Metal, which would influence Stoner/Sludge Metal bands, as the only alternative approach for non-hyperactive artists. Alongside this evolution, Doom would also crossover with other styles resulting in a lot of different <b>subgenres</b>, such as <b>Atmospheric Doom, Funeral Doom, Doom/Death</b> and <b>Dronemetal</b> or Dronedoom.

Because guitar velocity had become so high, Metal drummers developed a special hyper fast drum technique, called “<b>blast beats</b>”.

Black Metal has always been more about the content than the music itself, trying to be as <b>satanic</b> and <b>anti-Christian</b> as possible (and so are many of its practicers). The exact opposite however, is also true, in the form of Christian Black Metal, indicating that probably any genre imaginable already exists.<br><br>Black Metal bands are recognizable by their <b>bombastic music, satanic names, elaborate artwork</b> (usually with a chaotic web of sharp forms) and heavy <b>black & white make-up</b> (reminiscent of Glam Metal but much more grim and serious).

        "description": "Eventually the melancholic, haunting sounds of Gothic Rock found their way to heavy metal (Doom Metal has more in common with Classic Metal than Gothic Rock). The energy and wildness of other Metal was incompatible with Goth, but the much slower, darker Doom / Stoner Metal was almost proto Gothic Metal. True Gothic Metal is only a very small genre though, because the combination of Metal and Gothic is a<b> precariously balanced</b> one, quickly turning into Darkwave or something not Gothic. A more stable and durable genre was achieved by trading the synth sound for <b>classical music</b> (Symphonic Metal) with professional singers (<b>sopranos</b>, tenors…). The outcome is <b>chaotic, romantic</b> and mesmerizing Metal, but with a dark, <b>despairing and brutal undertone</b> (Doom meets Death) which made it appropriate to be also called Gothic Metal. Therefore it is advisable not to separate these genres as they share too much overlapping. Gothic Metal is known for the use of <b>female band leaders/vocalists </b>which makes the genre arguably the least macho of all Metal genres. With <b>melancholic</b> or <b>poetic</b> themes, usually embedded in an extremely <b>escapist fantasy world of angels, elves and crystalline beauty</b>, Gothic Metal could come straight out of The Lord of the Rings or a mythical role playing computer game. Heavy Metal has a number of very popular subgenres related to Gothic Metal, which also dwell on fantasy worlds (but this time of dwarves, druids and Vikings) like <b>Folk Metal</b> and <b>Viking Metal</b>.

The <b>heaviest</b> genres of the time (Death, Industrial Metal and Metalcore) were all thrown into an <b>eclectic mix</b>, but mostly Groove Metal and Rap Rock formed the basis for Nu Metal. These genres were only a small step away from fusing Rap or Breakbeat elements into Metal. The outcome was a recipe that could not fail because it was <b>Rap, Rock, and Metal all-in-one</b>. Indeed, “<b>New Metal</b>” had many <b>Rap</b> and few Metal <b>elements</b>: downtuned riffs, <b>breakbeats</b>, scratching, emphasis on kick drums and most noticeably <b>no guitar solos</b>, though the genre lacked no <b>heavy bass</b> or <b>aggressiveness</b>.  The difference between Nu Metal and Rap Metal is rather negligible; the latter is reserved for songs which explicitly feature Rap lyrics, though they are both heavily influenced by Rap Rock.<br><br>Nu Metal is often linked to <b>Emo</b>(core), as piercing lyrics about <b>frustration and depression</b> (self-mutilation, suicide, abuse, etc.) find its way into the heart of adolescents through <b>melancholic choruses</b>; a very distinctive rupture with previous Metal genres. <b>Fashion</b> is another topic where Nu Metal breaks the rules, with a <b>bizarre</b> mix of Emo and Metal styles and some marginal extravaganza.

    "description": "Rock in the fifties was still in the early stages of its infancy. The first Rock genres were rather unaffiliated and came from many different origins. The precise origin of Rock ‘n’ Roll is very complex and often part of a deeper debate. Skiffle, Rockabilly and Folk Revivals are all primitive forms of Rock, showing a slow development from different paths towards a more unified sound during Rock’s Golden Age. Be that as it may, Rock ‘n’ Roll itself – the main genre – was a groundbreaking milestone. The music broke great social barriers for the first time in history. Rock ‘n’ Roll connected white cultures (especially the average middle class white American young family) with black cultures (particularly exciting black R&B musicians). But Rock also connected the United Kingdom with the United States. British Skiffle was a reaction on the popularity of American Rock ‘n’ Roll. Alas, as Skiffle never broke through, Rock ‘n’ Roll became welcomed by the British, leading to British Blues Rock and the British Invasion. Last but not least, R‘n’R dissolves the musical barrier between young and old. That is to say: music expands from an adult-only form of entertainment to a vital part of any adolescent or teen life. Rock ‘n’ Roll gives the youth their own sound, their genre, their personal revolution against whatever their parents liked to listen.<br><br>Rock ‘n’ Roll introduces the typical Rock instrument set-up, consisting of four to five musicians (though three is possible as well): lead singer, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, drums, and bass (though the singer could also play an instrument). Rock ‘n’ Roll is based on the Jump Blues rhythm, with a heavily accentuated backbeat. Rock ‘n’ Roll is even faster than its direct predecessors Early Rhythm ‘n’ Blues and Jump Blues, with less emphasis on bass and a replacement of the double bass by the electric bass.<br><br>The etymology of “Rock ‘n’ Roll” reveals its subtext: the phrase is old African-American slang for sex. Of course not all Rock ‘n’ Roll songs deal about sex, but many were utterly shocking and hedonist for the conservative fifties and some artists put little effort in concealing their dirty mind. Take Jimmy Lloyd’s “Rocket in my Pocket” for example. Many parents expressed grave concerns and religious figures picked up the chant: Rock ‘n’ Roll was the music of the Devil. But forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest and Rock indulged in its own delicious aura of danger and excitement; an aura that kept lingering long after the era of Rock ‘n’ Roll. Interestingly, the term also refers to the type of dancing couples usually do on R’n’R, for example with the twist: “rocking” (dancing towards each other) and “rolling” (taking distance).<br><br>Rock ‘n’ Roll greatly loses its bold spirit in 1960 and the Rock craze starts to lie down. The music becomes well-behaved / politically correct and Soul takes over as the dominant music force (especially on radio and television), yet obviously lacks the characteristics of Rock ‘n’ Roll. The popularity of the “Twist”, a swinging and shaking type of dance, revives Rock in the early sixties and prevents the genre from becoming extinct before the British shape it into the rock solid foundation of popular music it has become.<br><br>Rock ‘n’ Roll itself has largely evaporated during consecutive decades. Apart from revivals of Rockabilly and Surf Rock in Japan, the music is mostly considered a thing of the past. However, retro interest in earlier subcultures (fashion, design, and music) of the thirties (Swing) and the fifties (Rock ‘n’ Roll) prove that Rock ‘n’ Roll can excite contemporary youth as much as it could in the fifties. Rock ‘n’ Roll after all equals tempo and energy; it compels people to lose themselves and become wild, lawless, hedonist – to become Rock and Roll.",

        "description": "Skiffle is one of the oldest popular music genres. Emerging in the twenties in the United States, early Skiffle can be seen as a <b>Folk influenced form of Proto-Country</b>; just like Ragtime can be seen as Proto-Jazz and Gospel as Proto R&B. Skiffle was music for the <b>poorest</b> of people, who created a true jack-of-all-trades musical <b>melting pot</b> with whatever instrument they could lay their hands on, as long as it was cheap: <b>fiddle, banjo, kanzoo</b>, and household items such as <b>washboards</b>. The biggest challenge was an inexpensive alternative for bass, which they found in large jugs. <b>Jug Bands</b> (actually a synonym for early Skiffle) even had to throw <b>pop-up homeparties</b> to pay the rent and their instruments, which were called “Skiffles”.<br><br>From 1949 until 1958 a Skiffle Revival takes place in the <b>United Kingdom</b>, parallel to the rise of early Rhythm ‘n’ Blues and Rock ‘n’ Roll. Because Britain lacked the history of Country music, almost all musicians <b>struggled with creating Rock ‘n’ Roll</b> music, as they had no access to a quintessential ingredient. In response to American R’n’R, poor British students responded with a type of <b>Folk-Blues-Rock</b>, that was very <b>loud, fast and noisy</b>. They used the same instruments as older American Jug Bands alongside cheap acoustic guitars. But by 1958, Rock ‘n’ Roll became so big, that Skiffle quickly decayed.",

        "description": "Rock ‘n’ Roll was musically speaking not a great step forward; its origins in Boogie Woogie and R&B were obvious. It was mainly a <b>racial</b> thing: young, attractive, <b>white singers</b> bringing black music <b>into the living rooms</b> of white people (especially girls), and turning heads by shaking their pelvis and/or standing on pianos. At the same time, Hillbilly Country musicians became influenced by early Country Blues and created <b>uptempo Country</b> with a <b>strong beat</b>, slapped upright bass, and <b>stuttering vocals</b>: Rockabilly. Both genres, as well as some Country music, originated on the famous <b>Sun Records</b> label in Memphis. Rock ‘n’ Roll often overlaps with Rockabilly’s simple, uptempo blues with <b>three chords</b>, a boogie back beat, and the holy instrument trinity of rock: <b>drums, guitar and bass</b>. As one can see, early Rock ‘n’ Roll was difficult to separate from early Rhythm ‘n’ Blues. However, the often overlooked effect of <b>amphetamine</b> (used heavily by many Rock ‘n’ Roll stars) changed the sound into the sociocultural revolution that it was: with their <b>trembling voices, exuberant behavior</b>, unbridled energy, and <b>sexual innuendo</b>, they introduced something new, something unheard of and “<b>bad to the bone</b>”. The later “<b>mod</b>” subculture of the fifties (sometimes mistaken for a music genre), were also very drawn into a similar world of bikes, speed, and rock ‘n’ roll. White teens went crazy around the world and soon Rock ‘n’ Roll became so popular that the term was used for anything <b>rebellious</b>, and often Rock music in general.",

        "description": "Rockabilly died almost as abruptly as it emerged when its main icons were either dead, in jail or in the army. Rock was not dead however; countless <b>ambitious teens</b> (mostly in the UK) got hooked on the sound and started forming their own Rock bands. More often than not, they rehearsed in the <b>garages</b> of their parents. The result was a very <b>raw, amateur, lo-fi</b> sound of Rock ‘n’ Roll and the first experiments with <b>distorted guitars</b>. Garage Rock is a genre where the “fuzz” distortion effect is used intensively (which makes the guitars sound fuzzy) and it helped spread “<b>the Fuzz sound</b>” across other genres. Such dirty distortion fits nicely with Garage Rock’s recurring content of <b>anger and frustration</b> about dealing with heartbreak, cheating and other negative love experiences. Although positive love madness could just as well be an inspiration. Because most Garage Rock musicians couldn’t afford decent audio equipment, there was often no budget for voice amplification, resulting in <b>wailing, screaming singers</b>. It wasn’t until the great British Invasion of the mid sixties that Garage Rock truly broke loose, with even more bands and <b>crossovers to Psychedelic Rock</b> as a result. As Garage Rock shares lots of overlapping with Psy Rock, the conjoining term <b>Garage-Psych</b> was conceived and later also included Shoegaze.<br><br>Garage Rock’s big teenage “fuck-you-we-do-what-we-want” <b>attitude</b> and sound inspired Punk Rock itself, as well as contemporary artists who felt a revival was well deserved. After all, Garage Rock is the embodiment of <b>sleaziness</b>, roughness, and <b>Rock’s nonchalance</b> in all its galore.",

    "name": "GOLDEN AGE / CLASSIC ROCK",
    "supergenre": true,
    "description": "The Golden Age of Rock or Classic Rock are terms not frequently used, but there is no debate about their meaning. Rock completely erupts in an unimaginable way in the sixties, which was so dominant that it still is considered by many music journalists as the most important popular music genre. Since this age, many music magazines, festivals, and books mention the adjective “Rock” as a portmanteau for all popular music. A lot of artists are still performing this very day and have become true Rock legends. In fact, the only ones that have stopped to do so are those who are dead. A proof of the passion these artists have for their music and the justification of the term “Golden Age”.<br><br>A large concurrence of events lies at the core of Classic Rock’s revolution. The aftershock of World War II starts to fade since 1958 and a long period of prosperity ensues. A believe in a better future, i.e. a world of peace and happiness, forms the blueprints of a strong countercultural hippie movement. Amphetamines (extensively used during WWII) became cheaper, more popular, more produced and remained legal until 1971. Amphetamines not only shaped Rock ‘n’ Roll but all Rock into the most energetic music at the time, whereas the popularity of psychedelic drugs led to experimenting and genre differentiation.  The contraceptive pill, invented in 1960, was one of the greatest pivotal moments of female emancipation of all time. In that same year, the British government relinquished the army service for boys. In one lucky strike, both the (British) female and male youth was liberated. Needless to say, the culmination of all these events resulted in a decade-long party, of which no-one wanted to experience the hangover.<br><br>Because of these historic events, most Classic Rock genres originated in the UK, but Rock quickly became hugely popular across the ocean. Legendary Rock neighborhoods of joy and libertinism, such as the Height Ashbury District, San Francisco, or Soho, London, proved sublime spawning pools for talent. In the UK, pirate radios start playing Rock music since 1964. Immediately, a notion of “rebelliousness” was identified with the music. In 1967 the government shuts down these radio stations, causing the gap between Pop and Rock to widen (radio vs live / mainstream vs alternative).<br><br>Classic Rock further incorporates elements from Blues and R&B and the universal blueprint for Rock takes hold. The music becomes more structured with a sequential pattern (verse-chorus-verse-chorus-break/solo-chorus), although the complete opposite was also true (Prog Rock and experimental Acid Rock, which could lack any sort of structure).<br><br>Typical about the Golden Age of Rock is the arrival of multi-tracking recording studios. Multi-tracking allows the composer to record different parts of the song and edit them separately. First there were only three tracks, soon four, then eight, and now 24+ is the standard. With multi-tracking one could also record, play and record again (overdubbing) to create a richer or “thicker” sound. Many other techniques suddenly became possible: time alteration, cutting, looping, echo, leslie speakers, etc. During the era of Classic Rock, all these pioneering techniques allowed the creation of music that could not be played live and albums became much more precious than before. They revealed intriguing, out-of-this-world music with experimental (often psychedelic) sounds, further adding to the Rock mania that was already taking place. Famous producers like George Martin, Brian Wilson and Phil Spector were extremely fast in unraveling all the secrets multi-tracking could unfold.<br><br>Even more so than in another super-genre, Classic Rock artists cannot be casted within one genre. In this highly experimental age, most artists show work in different genres on the same album. Crossovers from Blues (Blues Rock) to Metal (Classic Metal) make a neat partition of Classic Rock artists largely pointless.",

        "description": "Where the early London Rock scene was more concerned with Blues, the city of <b>Liverpool</b> took interest in <b>cleverly produced</b> music (<b>jukebox</b> music) such as Motown. Because Liverpool was a large harbor city frequented by ocean liners, the local music scene was more connected to American R&B than most British towns. After a while, <b>local vocal groups</b> (young eager Rock bands) started creating a new type of Rock with a strong <b>backbeat rhythm</b> and <b>polyphonic vocals</b>: a mix of Motown & R’n’R. As a result, their songs were sometimes soft and poppy with strings and obvious Soul influences, and at other times very uptempo and swinging.<br><br>Mersey Beat (called after the river Mersey in Liverpool) or simply ‘<b>Beat</b>’ was the great <b>second revolution of Rock</b>. Most noteworthy are <b>The Beatles</b>, who won the hearts of every teen in the UK and America, and who started out as a seemingly upright boysband but later revolutionized sound recording. Inspired by their huge success - a true <b>mania</b> - many British Mersey Beat bands took the journey across the ocean to <b>invade America</b> and become Rock stars, though few actually succeeded. This phenomenon and the genre itself, is since known as the British Invasion (though British Blues Rock was also a part of this invasion).<br><br>A particular subcultural phenomenon closely related to Mersey Beat, is the British <b>Mod scene</b> of the fifties and the sixties. Young rebellious <b>biker boys</b> were united in their stance against conformist Rock and preferred a blend of <b>sped up Rock ‘n’ Roll and Motown</b>. This eventually led to Beat Music (aka Merseybeat) and later to the New Romantics and even Britpop. With their speakers always on max volume and a healthy diet of pep pills, they were the vanguard of a new era of Rock – a Golden Age of guitars and soundwaves.",

A huge <b>spiritual hippie subculture</b> flourished in many places, especially those with a large student population. The principal among them was the famous <b>Height Ashbury district</b> in San Francisco, where accordingly people wore “flowers in their hair”. These young hippies were inspired by <b>eastern cultures</b> and music (particularly the works of Indian Raga musician Ravi Shankar), the structure and experimental nature of Free Jazz, and (of course) countless <b>psychedelic drugs</b>.

Because of its highly experimental nature and drug-and-peace-friendly appeal, many subgenres saw the light and were conjoined under the tag “<b>Psychedelia</b>”. Multiple revivals in the coming decades, such as the Paisley Underground and Neo-Psychedelia, are proof of the vastness and popularity of this genre.

Subsidized radio stations after this closure preferred a palette of Pop Rock and Soft Rock and created a hiatus for heavier, more alternative music. Hard Rock filled that gap with a <b>louder and faster kind of Blues Rock / Acid Rock</b> and is therefore the missing link between these genres and Heavy Metal. The genre quickly caught on with the masses. After all, it was <b>the first “heavy”</b> music genre to exist or certainly the heaviest at this time.<br><br>Hard Rock uses the same instrument set-up as basic Classic Rock but with more <b>distortion</b> on the guitars and <b>simple song structures</b>.

Though technically different, we will treat these three genres as one and the same for the sake of conciseness.<br><br>By the mid sixties the <b>new 33rpm long-play records</b> had pushed away the older 78rpm records, allowing for more playtime on one record. Thus shifted the focus from hit singles to <b>elaborate concept albums</b>, in which also longer songs were possible. Longer songs meant more opportunity to experiment with passages, structure and <b>song progression</b> (hence the genre name). The (modest) <b>freeform and crossover</b> of Acid Rock inspired some “progressive artists” to experiment as well, but more towards <b>classical</b> music than world music. Softer, longer, and intricate songs were the result, with lots of <b>tempo changes</b> and <b>special instruments</b> (like a <b>mellotron</b>). It was contemplative, difficult to write music and not really meant for live performances, but to be mastered to perfection on vinyl as the Holy Grail for the intellectual <b>audiophile</b>. Because during the sixties, another key event in music history occurred that explains Prog Rock’s appeal: the appearance of stereo headphones and <b>hi-fidelity speakers and home amplifiers</b>. <b>Stereo</b> becomes the norm instead of mono and music listening turns into an uncanny sensation through technology that still delivers excellent sound quality by today’s standards.<br><br>Although numerous artists jumped on the bandwagon, especially in Italy, France and Germany, only few attained public fame. In the late seventies and early eighties, an <b>emotional Prog</b>(ressive) <b>Revival</b> aka <b>Neo-Prog</b> (with the band Marillion as principal exponent) further nurtured the undying interest of selective fans.

In conclusion: Southern Rock is either a gentle Country balled with a touch of Blues Rock or a freight train rollercoaster looping and spinning off its tracks until the <b>shaking</b> boogie rhythm puts it back on again for another ride. In the 21st century, a new wave of Southern Rock artists comes on the scene such as the Kings of Leon and the Black Crowes.",

        "description": "When people think about Rock of the <b>seventies</b>, it’s usually not Hard Rock or Glam Rock, but the antagonistic “A.O.R.” short for <b>Adult</b> Oriented Rock (and not album oriented rock as sometimes described). A.O.R provided the counterweight for loud, sharp, in-your-face Rock within <b>more alternative and “mature”</b> circles, hence its name (though many adults were also college <b>students</b> in the beginning). The contrast with Hard Rock increased, leading to the antonym Soft Rock. A.O.R. has many synonyms such as American Rock, <b>Arena Rock, Stadium Rock</b>, Late Hard Rock and <b>Pomp Rock</b>. These names already show the massive popularity of the genre and the allegedly pompousness of many acts. Strongly reminiscent of Prog Rock, A.O.R. bands focused on the album as a whole (singles were less important) and they were filled with <b>long and varying songs</b>. A.O.R is a lot more <b>catchy and accessible</b> than Prog Rock (though experimentation is not out of the question). The main reason for A.O.R.’s success does not lie in its <b>glossy production</b> or the combination of <b>dramatic guitar chords</b> with <b>simple drum patterns</b>. Though this certainly helped, its success lies in a twisted nostalgia of the free spirit of the sixties, and a strong desire to <b>forget all negative things</b> of the early seventies: Vietnam, Watergate and the Iran War. A.O.R. is a Flower Power Fata Morgana.<br><br>Heartland Rock can be seen as a subgenre of A.O.R. This music genre emerged in <b>1979</b> and quickly gained momentum as it was made for the everyday <b>blue collar hard-working American</b>. The name refers to the “Heartland” of America, which are the Midwestern states of the U.S.",

    "description": "Punk, Post-Punk, and New Wave form a well-documented chapter in the history of Rock, probably because the protagonists show so much evolution in such a short time span. What started as the plainest and purest form of Rock, changed into a conceptual movement embracing the eccentric. In the beginning Punk formed the antipode for what New Wave would later become: mass-appeal, interest from adults, heavy post-production, stardom, eclecticism. The exact same trademarks of Progressive and Stadium Rock from the early seventies which fueled Punk’s revolt in the first place. Rock had lost all connection with the young crowd and a return to the roots was far past due.<br><br>Punk mentality goes back beyond the seventies: the concept of short, powerful riffs and brief, energetic songs can be traced to the roots of Power Pop.  So called “power chords” not only form the basis for Punk, but even became parodied in a famous quote by Punk magazine Sniffin’ Glue: “Here’s a chord. Here’s another one. That’s three. Now go and form a band!” This quote reveals much about the amateurism of early Punk Rock bands. Punk was almost a statement about ineptitude: anyone could do it. And indeed, some famous artists couldn’t even read notes or barely play guitar. As a living paradigm of protest, Punk knew how to bring music back to the youth: raw, sincere, lo-fi, spontaneous. This is very similar to what happened in Jamaica around the same time: Punk and Reggae were brothers in arms, protesting against authority and returning music to the streets. Punk is Robin Hood in leather and pins. A culture of DIY and sleaziness (drugs, vandalism, squatting, riots, graffiti) blends in with such epitome of enfant terrible, made by and for “punks”: kids who are up to no good. And this is what has made Punk attractive during all these years. Just like Garage Rock and Grunge, Punk is raw: the shredded remains of all eclectic and “intellectual” Rock genres down the meat grinder.<br><br>Technically, Punk uses a faster tempo than most Rock genres with sparse instrumentation. Chords are simple but powerful and vocals are usually with a small dynamic range, except when screamed. But Post-Punk and New Wave use more extensive song structure, vocal range and instrumentation. A technical common ground seems therefore far off. What binds these different styles is the power of idea and a strong emphasis on the visual, particularly fashion. The whole era of Punk and Wave is dominated by powerful imagery, shocking personalities and new technology.  Both Punk and Wave focus on concept and message. These are not songs about everyday life or personal feelings. Punk and Wave are about the fabric of society in a pessimist, cynical, undermining, or melancholic manner.<br><br>The genealogy of Punk and Wave starts with a scattered plethora of Punk subgenres, such as Queercore, Cowpunk, Gypsy Punk, Riot Grrrl, Celtic Punk, Street Punk, Art Punk, Oi!-Punk, Skate Punk, Pop Punk, Psychobilly & Horror Punk, Ska Punk,… Punk becomes almost a one-size-fits-all suffix. The viability of every crossover is put to the test and only the most influential or durable are listed on the map. Retrospectively, Punk branched into two large music streams: Hardcore Punk and Post-Punk/Wave. When New Wave starts to embrace the synthesizer and crosses over to Pop (= Synthpop), it suppresses Post-Punk and pushes it underground (into Gothic/Industrial). Although Synthpop & New Wave might differ greatly from Punk, they use similar concepts of Dadaism and collage as well as expanding these concepts to art forms beyond music, e.g. fashion and performance art. Industrial (and Gothic) inherited Punk/Wave’s intrusion of reality, taking over as popular music’s ultimate insurgent.",

        "description": "Punk Rock probably was the biggest <b>revolution</b> in Rock history, although the build-up was already tangible in the British bars in the form of Pub Rock. The economic and political situation in Britain during the early seventies made a few <b>young up-to-no-good kids</b> (“punks”) really angry. In the US, they rediscovered the similar forgotten Garage Rock mentality, but the most important contributor of Punk was a strong <b>backlash against “Stadium Rock”</b> of the early seventies. Popular Prog Rock and A.O.R. bands started to reach massive (and more mature) audiences and Rock had become an eclectic spectacle for the elite masses. It was time for <b>a return to the primordial roots</b> of Rock – to give the youth back its stolen and deformed middle finger.<br><br>The music was Hard / Garage Rock, but much <b>shorter, faster, energetic, raw</b> and <b>stripped</b> to the base chords which blended in with the rapidly growing out of control <b>Punk subculture</b>. Many early amateur Punk Rock band names were <b>gross</b> and <b>sleazy</b>: Punk liked to indulge in a provocative culture of <b>extreme haircuts</b> (flashy colors, moehawks, sharp peaks), <b>rebellious fashion</b> (disorderly, rough, torn) and <b>disgusting behavior</b>, such as snorting very foul amphetamine sulphate crystals as they were the cheapest drug around. The difference with Industrial was that you could really go wild and dance to it, thus explaining its unfathomable magnetism. A lot of UK Punk was witnessed in the <b>Roxy club</b>, London, whereas US Punk evolved mainly out of the legendary club <b>CBGB’s</b>, New York (which also propelled Post-Punk and New Wave).",

        "description": "Punk Rock was besides music also a <b>marketing machine</b>, cleverly steered by the movement’s frontman and Sex Pistol’s manager Malcolm Mclaren. In response, a new subgenre answered to the machine: Anarcho-Punk (which lent its name from the Sex Pistol’s infamous single “Anarchy in the UK”). It wasn’t really anarchistic though, mostly <b>reactionary towards Punk Rock</b>. These bands swore by heavy <b>DIY</b> approach, <b>little marketing or publicity</b>, and by their <b>own</b> record <b>production</b>, forming the <b>prelude to Hardcore Punk</b>. A strong <b>community</b> sense, is another trademark of Anarcho-Punk, both by the artists and their fans. But most importantly (as there is not much difference in sound with early Punk Rock) are <b>real political messages</b>, fueled by a distaste for the lyrical shallowness of some of Punk Rock’s most famous bands. Political reaction grew stronger when conservative Margaret Thatcher took office in the UK in 1979,  who proved to be a long lasting punching bag for Punk’s offspring genres.<br><br>A while after the development of Hardcore Punk (around 1985), Anarcho-Punk gets heavily <b>influenced by Extreme Metal</b> (both Black and Speed). This is clearly discernible in both a <b>more chaotic and faster</b> sound. Two Punk Rock subgenres emerge: Crust (Punk) aka <b>Crustcore</b> and D-Beat or <b>Discore</b>. Crust is a heavy, <b>bass-filled</b> style, much more <b>nihilistic and bleak</b> than Anarcho and the predecessor of Grindcore. D-Beat or Discore is a smaller and more straightforward style named after its repetitive, <b>stuttering drum beats</b>, which was particularly popular in Sweden.",

        "description": "Punk Rock, or more accurately the Punk movement, died around the same time Disco reached her peak. The <b>fall of Punk juxtaposed to the rise of Disco</b> casted a gloomy shadow of both <b>fear and hate</b> among Rock artists. This can be witnessed in the many genres interwoven in the same sociocultural framework as Post-Punk: Early Industrial and Noise genres, Gothic Rock and the No Wave movement. But the immediate aftermath of Punk was Post-Punk: Punk Rock without its edges, but also without some of its amateurism and naivety. In this genre, a <b>dark, arty struggle</b> is noticeable; a difficult coping with what society had become and the <b>impotence of music to change</b> it. One must not forget for example, that 1973 was the year of the first <b>Oil Crisis</b> (which was rapidly followed by the second one in 1979) with long-term international effects on employment and income.<br><br>Post-Punk songs became longer, less explosive/aggressive but more complex and challenging. Many Post-Punk songs display a tendency for <b>repetitive elements</b>, to induce a certain trance. Searching for <b>new structures</b>, Post Punk (a subcultural movement on its own) explored less conventional techniques and instruments, while immersing itself deeply in the “Black” music of <b>Funk and Dub</b>. These interests trickled down through Post-Punk into other innovative genres such as Madchester and Trip Hop. Different Post-Punk songs can sound entirely different and a cohesive definition of the genre is lacking. The <b>experimental</b> nature of Post-Punk prevented a true countermovement as there was no unified sound, merely an endless quest. Only New Wave was capable of shedding a light at the end of the tunnel.",

No Wave was a cultural <b>avant-garde</b> movement sprawling forth out of the <b>darker, more industrial and abandoned places</b> of <b>New York City</b> and the work of avant-garde bands like Suicide and The Velvet Underground. A number of intellectual artists could no longer bear the <b>depressing</b> events of the seventies, nor the irony of the rising tendency to make New Wave catchier and happier. In the <b>concrete</b> underground jungle of their urban warzone, they created a soundtrack fit for total <b>apocalypse</b>: instrumental, <b>atonal</b>, <b>eclectic</b>, super pissed off and depressing <b>post-Post-Punk-proto-Grunge</b>. Often there were <b>extremely chaotic passages</b> directly inspired from Free Jazz. But No Wave was more than just music: directors, inspired by the French <b>Nouvelle Vague</b> movement and performance artists displayed similar expressions of <b>deconstructivism and nihilism</b>. The minimal lifespan of No Wave (the entire scene lasted from 1978 to 1982) can be explained by an <b>absence of a unified goal</b>. All No Wave artists were connected by their <b>rejection of everything (“NO”)</b>, yet failed to become a conglomerated movement. If it weren’t for Brian Eno’s infamous compilation “<b>No New York</b>”, No Wave’s face would probably still be masqueraded in grainy low-key shadows it so dearly embraced.",

The release of the Yamaha DX7 in 1983 as the penultimate polyphonic synthesizer dramatically increases the production of Synthpop music. Guitars are barely noticeable, if they are present at all or not replaced by “keytars”. The difference between original New Wave and mid-eighties Synthpop is quite large.

Another difference is the increased emphasis on <b>fashion, style, glamour and make-up</b>. However, the gradual evolution from Wave to Synthpop ensures that a lot of music falls in between and New Wave becomes an interchangeable term with Synthpop. In this momentum a temporary movement also existed, known as the <b>New Romantics</b>: a hybrid Synthpop/Wave with Disco influences.<br><br>Synthpop can be a misguiding term, as the genre is probably the least Pop-like of all Pop genres in terms of mentality.

    "description": "Hardcore Punk evolved out of the dominant musical era of Punk Rock in the late seventies. When the eighties arrived, many artists were fed up with Punk’s excesses (or at least Punk’s reputation as media liked to exaggerate on its scandals), or else they were disillusioned by the evaporation of Punk’s political message. What started as merely a subgenre of Punk (among many others), grew exponentially both in the US and the UK. A number of bands were on the rise that tried to implement either political content or a notion of purity: both in music and lifestyle.  Hardcore bands emerged like fresh mushrooms from the rotten Punk soil. Especially in the US, every region or city received its own famous Hardcore band and every high school experienced their local amateur Hardcore teen band.<br><br>Technically, Hardcore is based on Punk Rock, but much faster and with shorter, bursting songs. It’s like a Punk Rock song of three or four minutes is compressed in a time span of less than two minutes. Such high speed has obviously an effect on voice: Hardcore vocalists shout with short bursting strokes, almost like an army sergeant. Instrumentation, song structure and sound manipulation however, stay similar to Punk.<br><br>Hardcore is more defined within its lifestyle: a subculture of discipline and purity. Many Hardcore bands and fans live by a strict anti-hedonist code, with no drugs, healthy food, bald or shaven haircut, jeans and shirts, and badges or pins marking honor and respect. Nevertheless, the average perception of Hardcore Punk leans towards the negative, as the music is often associated with aggression and violence due to the musical content and the appearance of fans or bands. But this is mostly because of a lack of knowledge about the subculture.<br><br>A strong sense of community and pride sways over Hardcore culture, with recurring mottos like “Hardcore Will Never Die” and “Forever Hardcore”.  It is peculiar to see that the same mentality of strength - with comradeship and slogans - is also traceable in Hardcore Techno, a genre that technically is very different from Hardcore Punk. Mosh pits, a type of “dance” where the crowd violently starts kicking and pushing each other around (“moshing”) in a circle, also found its origin in Hardcore culture and remains a common part of it.<br><br>Hardcore is mostly an underground thing; mainstream radio or TV attention is minimal, despite a very radio friendly format (regarding song length). Instead, Hardcore lives – stronger than any other super-genre – in the show or gig. Hardcore gigs are smaller than other ones and usually indoors. However, the crowd is often downright fanatic and the interaction between band and crowd is bigger, with smaller and lower stages. There where the DIY approach of Hardcore gets translated into performance, where electric synergy between band and crowd occurs, where mosh pits organically evolve and dissolve again, where communities get formed…that is where Hardcore is home.<br><br>By merging with Heavy Metal, Hardcore Punk diversifies and knows how to reinvent itself. But the most intriguing thing about Hardcore is not the music or subculture, but a far-reaching ethos of DIY (do-it-yourself) that exposes society conventions within music industry and how they are all too easily accepted instead of challenged. Hardcore works largely with small record labels, or band members release their very own record label. Artists become entrepreneurs and distance themselves from capitalism. With the help of local support, such as T-shirt sales, they manage to survive and maintain their musical integrity. Though certainly not all Hardcore bands were anti-commercial or against major record companies. In fact, the failure of a mainstream breakthrough of (Post-)Hardcore bands, urged certain bands to change their sound. This offered them a larger audience, though they were still forced to work with smaller, independent labels. And thus Indie Rock was born.",

Hardcore Punk became even <b>faster</b>, with even <b>shorter songs</b>, forcing the drummer to incorporate a new style of thrashing drumwork to match the insane tempo, called “<b>Blast Beats</b>”. Some Hardcore bands, such as Suicidal Tendencies and Bad Religion, created a faster type of music strongly linked to the <b>Skater subculture</b>. This early form or <b>first wave of Skate Punk </b>shared a lot of similarities with Thrashcore. Because many related bands experiment with all these genres (Skate Punk, Thrashcore, and both Thrash crossovers), their musical crossovers form an interesting, blurry mix of styles conjoined as Crossover Thrash; a noun often forgotten in favor of its more successful successors Grindcore and Metalcore.

But the term is rather vague, as what Rock genre from the mid-eighties onwards could really be considered mainstream?

Alternative Rock is therefore a collection of different styles from the mid-eighties till the end of the millennium, yet with more common ground than contemporary Rock genres.<br><br>Alternative or “Alt” Rock is recognizable by jangly guitars, lots of distortion pedals, distortion on amps, sentimental or dark lyrics and sometimes small influences from synth.

Songs are often longer than any other Rock super-genre (apart from Prog Rock) and average tempo is lower than R‘n’R, Punk Rock, or Hardcore, making it fairly slow as far as Rock goes.<br><br>The name Indie Rock comes from the abbreviation of “independent” as in independent record label, also known as an “indie”. Indies are smaller, less profit oriented companies as opposed to big-business major record companies, known as “majors”. Indies were either a deliberate choice or the only resort for a large stream of young amateur bands. These starting musicians felt either very strong about the integrity of their music, which they didn’t want to jeopardize by the whims of major producers, or they failed to break through into mainstream.<br><br>Alternative Rock and Indie Rock are synonyms. The latter is the term used by the British music press and the former by the American press at the time of the music’s heydays. Sometimes Indie Rock is reserved for the first wave of Alternative Rock (during the eighties), because at that time all bands were signed up to indies. After the success of Grunge, more alternative Rock bands get signed up to bigger labels, forcing the British and American press to switch terms, while American journalists also refer to their first wave of Alt Rock as “College Rock”.<br><br>Alternative Rock is highly underestimated considering the Big Boom of EDM bursting open at the same time. During that era, Rock remained a tower of strength, defying this avalanche of brand new, exciting electronic music genres. The reason for such popularity is unclear, but an important contributor is the fact that Alternative Rock knew how to connect to all the anger, frustration, doubt, fear and depression of the youth of the nineties. More than any other super-genre, Alternative Rock is a psychologist digging deep into the dark soul of any teenager or adolescent and acting as a tourniquet to heal wounds with music. A strong anti-establishment mentality (against majors, governments, or shallow society conventions) also helped Indie keep Rock alive until the new millennium.<br><br>Two merits that mark pivotal moments in music history fall on behalf of Indie. On one hand, an increase in attention towards young, up-and-coming Rock talent with more labels, chances to perform and more alternative radio stations. On the other hand, the way becomes paved for female Rock (and Pop) artists. Common words in the music industry like “front-man” ceased to make sense, exposing their sexist nature that sprouted from a long lasting tradition of Rock macho culture.<br><br>Indie Rock hasn’t gone extinct, but lives on as a parallel Rock stream in the nillies and tens (3rd wave of Alternative Rock).  The genre is still popular, but this has also to do with the fact that the term has become an easy label for any raw, traditional, heavy Rock band that is hard to categorize. Retrospectively, a lot of bands that were labeled (or even are being labeled) as “Alternative” weren’t really. The word alternative just sounded pretty cool in conjunction with Rock: it was a perfect marketing device that dwelled on a mainstream-phobia among adolescents and artists alike.",

        "description": "By the end of the eighties, the power of Hard Rock or the spirit of Punk Rock seemed nowhere to be found. The majority of Rock had become electronic and commercialized (Synthpop). Many <b>Generation X</b> rock artists tried to stay away from the big record companies (the “Majors”) to prevent their music from succumbing to the same fate and turned to smaller, independent labels instead (the “<b>Indies</b>”), where they had the freedom to make what they liked: <b>serious, downbeat</b> rock with <b>heavy, distorted</b> guitar riffs, often dealing about <b>emotional troubles</b> or tragic thoughts. Many important indies (who later became majors) were part of this era: SST, Dischord, and Sire Records. Alternative Rock takes pride in an <b>entirely self-made</b> process through teamwork, <b>college radio</b> support, and peer collaborations. The music consciously partakes in the debate about music industry, with a strong stance<b> against MTV, video</b> clips, compact discs, and a <b>stance pro vinyl and artistic graphic design</b>. To strengthen and justify its own point of view, Indie Rock often uses objectified lyrics instead of a personal perspective.<br><br>Early Alternative Rock music was primarily college radio music (thus for and by students), with <b>jangly guitars</b> and a minimal attention to rhythm. Therefore it became known as “Jangle Pop”. Closely related and heavily overlapping with college Jangle Pop was the <b>Paisley Underground</b> movement (named after the artists their retro psy paisley shirts) : a revival of 60s Psychedelic Rock in L.A. with a variety of Rock and Folk influences, fueled by a loathing escape from Glam Metal.",

        "description": "Noise Rock started much later than its predecessor No Wave (around 1986-’87) as a small but influential offshoot. In a way, the genre is a sort of<b> missing link between Hardcore Punk and Alternative Rock</b>. Inspired by not only Hardcore’s aggression but also its strict and drug-free lifestyle, Noise Rock deliberately <b>turned its back on</b> the excesses of the final <b>Punk Rock</b> movement. Noise Rock artists liked Punk Rock, but they were repulsed by what it had turned into. Idealism and revolution were replaced by nonchalance and chain tweaking. Based on Proto Punk Rock’s experimentation and No Wave’s <b>nihilistic and destructive mentality</b>, Noise Rock used that aversion to fuel songs of high-octane hate. Unsurprisingly, Noise Rock is extremely <b>atonal/dissonant</b> with <b>massive guitar feedback</b>. This just in case some milliseconds of the song would not be saturated with noise. Riffs are slower than Hardcore Punk, but faster than most Rock and often at low frequency.  Singers <b>scream angry lyrics</b> on (or over) the top of their lungs that usually make <b>no sense</b> whatsoever or are highly <b>offensive</b>. The result is a serious contender for the most <b>chaotic</b> of all genres including Grindcore and Black Metal. Besides the US, <b>Japan</b> is a large distributor of Noise Rock (the country’s history of chaotic music is unparalleled worldwide). Noise Rock should not be confused with <b>Noise Pop</b>, which is related  but very different and more similar to Dream Pop. Though small and unpopular, Noise Rock was a <b>great influence</b> on later music genres, such as Sludge (thanks to the Melvins) and Grunge.",

Just like the Paisley Underground, this Psychedelic Rock revival - known as <b>Neo-Psy</b> - was based on <b>sixties’ jangly guitars</b> and <b>many sound effects</b>. Around 1982-’83, Dream Pop branches off from Neo-Psy: a softer, more ambient version and in fact a kind of <b>Proto-Post-Rock</b>. Later, a part of Neo-Psy evolved into a new kind of “Acid Indie Rock”, called Shoegaze or Shoegazing, but sometimes Dream Pop and Shoegaze are used as interchangeable terms. Shoegaze is filled with <b>layered</b>, heavily <b>distorted</b> guitars (with <b>feedback</b>), washing over each other to create a <b>spacy, atmospheric, textured sound</b>, which is sometimes referred to as a “wall of noise”. Yet this music is (just like Stoner Rock) not really noise, just very <b>droning, loud and psychedelic</b>. The name Shoegaze was derived from the fact that some artists actually stared at their shoes while performing. Neo-Psy, including Dream Pop and Shoegaze, continues in the nineties, forming a parallel stream next to other Alternative Rock.<br><br>In <b>Manchester</b>, an influential nightlife scene evolved around Shoegaze. This scene was dubbed “<b>Madchester</b>” or “<b>Baggy</b>” (because of the artists their baggy trousers), where Indie and Acid Rock played alongside (Acid) House, bridging two separate party worlds within sacred dance temples of drugs and ecstasy (such as the legendary <b>Hacienda</b> club). Madchester is a genre more defined by its geographical origin and its leading label <b>Factory Records</b> than anything else, but extremely entertaining nevertheless.",

        "description": "The focus on glamour and fashion in many eighties’ music formed the catalyst of a fierce <b>anti-movement</b>. Fierce may not exactly be the right word for it. Being the complete <b>opposite of Glam Rock</b>, this so-called “Grunge” (the name is negative slang for horrible noisy rock) was humble and inwards, with <b>sincere</b> songs about <b>tragedy</b> and frustrations. The sound on the other hand was <b>dirty, distorted, lo-fi, vintage and crunchy</b> as if it was composed by accident. Grunge often uses <b>distortion on the amps</b>, creating an even more abrasive sound. <b>Grunge “fashion”</b> reinforces such a notion of nonchalance: blue jeans, woolen lumberjack shirts, and dirty, sleazy long hair.<br><br>Grunge’s brief but crowd-gathering music revolution started all in the cold and remote city of <b>Seattle</b>. Typical about the Seattle music scene in the eighties was a high popularity of Classic and Thrash Metal. When emotional <b>Post-Hardcore</b> bands pop up all across the states, the genre gets <b>mixed with Metal</b> and becomes Grunge (it is often said that Grunge is one part Metal one part Hardcore/Rock). Grunge is closely related to the second wave of Alternative Rock, which was an immediate result of it. Within the <b>negative emotional context</b> of Grunge and Alt Rock, resorting to heroin use is not uncommon, further adding to the tragedy. The success of Grunge lies in the strength of a return to the mutual core of Rock and Blues. Something that had been lost along the way: <b>raw, unbridled emotion</b> that seemed so hard to bear that it even distorted the music itself. ",

But at the start of the nineties, a real genre emerges: Hard Alternative, Rap Rock, Rapcore, or Funk Metal. Strictly speaking, these are all different genres but so closely related, it’s pointless to separate them. In short, they are <b>heavier, faster types of Alternative Rock</b>, with strong influences from (classic East Coast) Rap music, sharing the same ferocity and anti-commercial mindset. One must not forget after all, that Rap was still “fresh” in 1990 (especially in Europe) even though it was already sixteen years old. As a result, artists were eager to <b>infuse Rap</b> in contrasting genres such as Acid House and Hardcore/Alt Rock.<br><br>The <b>lyrics</b> are <b>fast</b>, in a raplike way (or even true raps), and the music is more <b>rhythmical</b> than other types of Rock.

        "description": "Alternative Rock is almost never divided into two distinct genres, but just like Dubstep and Nu R&B, it should be. After the big Grunge revolution, Indie Rock experienced a metamorphosis and splintered in many subgenres, which were all a <b>response to Grunge</b> in one way (positive) or another (negative).<br><br>Many Indie Rock artists changed the genre into a <b>darker, heavier version</b> of itself, with more <b>desperate tragedy and angry frustration</b> in its lyrics. It also lost some of its Hardcore and DIY influences, with songs becoming <b>longer, more complex and better produced</b>. The second wave of Alternative Rock was no longer truly alternative, and their artists less and less a part of independent record labels. Some Alternative Rock bands even became bestselling stars, filling <b>Rock festivals</b> (also in an after-Grunge state of booming) for decades to come. With so many spotlights on Alt Rock, a tremendous opportunity unveiled itself for the innumerable amount of <b>independent female front artists</b> to tilt Rock music from a macho, male-dominated bastion into what appeared as gender equality: arguably the biggest <b>emancipation wave</b> in music history. Some women went further and created a Punk-influenced feminist subgenre, known as <b>Riot Grrrl</b>. <br><br>But instead of building further on Grunge’s legacy, a number of alternative subgenres reacted against it. There was too much stardom and too much focus from majors on Grunge and Alternative Rock. <b>Kurt Cobain’s suicide</b> (frontman of Nirvana) in <b>1994</b> was an immediate and cataclysmic consequence of this, which rocked the entire world of popular music to its foundation. Two <b>underground subgenres</b> emerged: the heavily under-produced Lo-Fi (Rock) and the minimal Slo(w)core aka Sadcore.  <b>Lo-Fi</b> is primarily defined by its <b>low-fidelity sound</b>, which can take on extreme forms (imagine a cassette tape that is nearing the end of its lifecycle) to ensure a total rencouncement of mainstream attendance. <b>Slowcore</b> is a very important subgenre (and still popular) that is deliberately the opposite of Grunge: <b>gentle</b> and <b>slow</b>, <b>placid</b>, and filled with tender, fragile sounds.",

The result of this “Post-Rock” was indeed drastically different; one can easily recognize the <b>spaced out, ambient</b> sound. Post-Rock <b>revolted against</b> both the self-indulgent attitude of <b>alternative</b> rock bands, more concerned with coolness than sound <b>and</b> the greedy <b>commercial</b> bands, composing whatever sells best. <br><br>The songs are almost <b>hypnotic</b>, taking the listener on a <b>musical voyage</b>. Of course the synthesizer is a key instrument of Post-Rock, especially to create <b>droning sounds</b>, while drums and (only) the gentle bass guitar form a steady background structure. Post-Rock <b>lacks a classic song structure</b> (verse-chorus) to create surprising music and likes to implement <b>unusual techniques on traditional</b> Rock <b>instruments</b>. There are guitars, drums, and bass but one would hardly recognize them in a familiar Rock way. Post-Rock might have been called Ambient Pop, being very <b>soft</b> with hardly any riffs or noticeable guitars, but that would do the <b>experimental nature</b> of the genre inadequate justice.",

    "description": "For the lack of a proper name, “Contemporary” Rock signifies all new Rock genres in the 21st century. Although this may sound like a meaningless term for the sake of creating a false portmanteau, Contemporary Rock genres share common characteristics, though not technical ones. Generally speaking, two dominant forces control and shape the rise of these genres (and not only in the world of Rock music): recycling and eclecticism. Cut-and-paste techniques form new genres out of old ones. Choice is power and originality/experimentation is overrated. Rock bands focus on the quality of their music and the search of a personal sound, instead of desperately christening a new crusade in the form of genre. The great boom of music genres in the nineties (not only EDM, but also Indie) must undoubtedly have led to genre fatigue and escapism in unclassifiable sound, of which “contra-genres” such as Witch House are the physical proof. Indeed, one might argue that in the 21st century, genre has become alternative or obscure, and fusion has become mainstream.<br><br>A technical definition of Contemporary Rock is lacking. The genre uses different influences to create a new concept of Rock music. Synthesizers – once revolutionary and exciting – have become an ordinary Rock instrument like guitar or drums. With influences from Pop, Electronic and even Folk, anything is possible.  One could say that Contemporary Rock is defined by being any kind of Rock different from the past. But not even this is true, as Garage Rock and Post-Punk revivals form the exception to that rule.<br><br>The power of Contemporary Rock lies in reaching out and building bridges towards other music genres. The age of subcultural niches (us against them) has ceased. The era of genre competition has faded. The ambiguous non-genre “Mash-Up” is a striking example of this; Mash-Up combines all kinds of genres into an eclectic mix, full of surprises and a deliberate mashing of unrelated styles.<br><br>Around 1999-2002, Dance becomes more popular than (Alternative) Rock, instilling fear in the hearts of many Rock enthusiast. Yet at the beginning of the millennium (around 2003-2004), Contemporary Rock proved powerful enough to push Dance music back underground. Today the genre remains a powerhouse among popular music, although Contemporary Rock and the arrival of ever more music streaming apps and websites already hint that in the future there will be no more genre monopoly, but a rather equal spread of popularity among all genres, whichever ones that may be.<br><br>It is at the very least striking to see that in a society with abundant injustice (financial crisis, climate change, terrorism, racism and migration problems, energy crisis, growing income gap,…), new protest music genres embedded in reactionary subcultures fail to emerge. This may only be explained through the even larger impact on artists of countering forces in contemporary society: globalization, mass-communication, secularisation, techno-materialism, capsulation, and isolation. But Rock must not take the fall for these contemporary behavioural patterns. All super-genres struggle to bring purist styles to the table and to maintain the confined identity they once had. However, if there is one thing Contemporary Rock and consorts such as Mash-Up can teach us, is that we should regard all popular music as one big, indestructible family instead of a list of groups: an intricate network of nodes – a constellation of sound.",

Yet a second wave of British artists in the late nineties valued these merits higher than cultural preservation.

Avant-garde bands like Radiohead and The Verve spearheaded this transition in their later works, but were only a vague sign of things to come. The popularity of Post-Britpop bands quickly outgrew traditional Britpop, making Post-Britpop a sort of <b>Stadium Rock of the nillies</b>. A number of bands returned to the original sound of Britpop, but with contemporary Rock influences such as The Kaiser Chiefs or Bloc Party. With success comes envy and Post-Britpop songs eventually became accused of sounding too <b>uniform, sterile and predictable</b>.

However, Emo Rock bears little resemblance to its predecessor Emocore: the genre is more a <b>sentimental and emotional form of Indie Rock</b> than an alternative version of Emo.

With far more <b>politically correct lyrics</b> than the first wave of Emo Rock bands, the mainstream appeal of Emo becomes so large that after 2001 a brief but intense <b>emo hype</b> takes hold. By now the term “Emo” has become familiar to the general public and a well established <b>teenage subculture</b>.

        "description": "The start of the new millennium purveyed an <b>ominous future</b> for Rock music. Alternative Rock was far past its peak and all that remained was Post-Rock and Post-Britpop.

Both Garage Rock and Post-Punk were held in high esteem as “<b>pure and rough Rock genres</b>”, leading to Garage and Post-Punk revivals. Although these genres are clearly different, influences from both Shoegazing and Alternative Rock and further cross-influence made their revivals almost <b>impossible to separate</b>. Hence they are conjoined under the name “Nu-Rawk”. The choice of reviving said old genres by new standards worked better than expected and now Nu-Rawk can be seen as the genre that <b>revitalized Rock</b> in the new millennium. Its moment of fame was shortlived however, except a small number of bands with continuous popularity who rose to great fame. As always in music history, shortly after the pendulum swung the other way and Nu-Rawk changed into the eclectic Dance Punk.",

In a way, New Prog(ressive) is like Prog Metal: a means to classify recent Rock bands that are hard to categorize, but who share a love for original Progressive Rock while staying underground. From the mid nillies onwards, there has been a rise in <b>eclectic bands</b> with a natural talent towards <b>experimentation and high contrast</b> unfrequently used in other genres. This Post-Prog wave differs from the original Prog Rock by an affinity for newer, <b>heavier genres</b> (especially the sharp ones, such as Punk, Hardcore, and Speed Metal). This makes Nu Prog no more eclectic than other Contemporary Rock genres such as Dance-Punk or Chillwave, but it places it at the other side of the spectrum: away from Pop and House.

Chillwave has a very <b>summery mood</b>, full of <b>optimism</b> and <b>dreamy Pop vocals</b>. Eighties retro (further enhanced in a dark way by the successor Synthwave) and <b>lots of reverb</b> on different song parts make it seem like Dream Pop is back from the dead.

    "description": "Pop music is difficult to define. The content of its definition has shifted throughout the course of time. What started as a network of white songwriters manufacturing premade songs for crooners and groups (Tin Pan Alley), became an individual crusade (singer/songwriter) and eventually a herald for integration and emancipation, where blacks as artists and teens as audience were given recognition and a platform.<br><br>From the sixties until the eighties, Rock forms the basis for Pop, but that foundation shifts towards House in the nineties and R&B/Rap in the nillies. Lately (from 2010 onwards), Pop has become too eclectic to identify another super-genre within as the dominant core. Whatever that core may be, Pop is always a lighter, more accessible variant with catchy, pronounced melodies, but not too complex. Pop songs are always 100% radio friendly, i.e. they are edited to play up to four minutes or less and have politically correct lyrics, often bordering on shallowness. Pop has plain song structures, which are easy to memorize and so are the chords or melodies. A strong focus on video clips and visual performance have become staples in the Pop industry throughout the years, as most Pop does try to sell. More than any other super-genre, Pop has a commercial nature, or – in better terms – Pop transmutes in what sells the most.<br><br>The word “Pop” is short for popular music and first coined in the fifties. Crooners from that decade were the first to be mentioned as “pop”. These artists had a tremendous popular appeal and their songwriters would seek inspiration from the most diverse genres in order to attain the perfect success formula. This means that at first Pop was not seen as a separate genre, but a collection of music from different genres that are the most popular. This is of course a matter of perspective. But although Pop may be vague as a group, especially in the beginning, its various subsequent subgenres are often well-defined. Therefore Pop is rightfully a super-genre on its own. Sometimes Pop is being used as a term for all popular music, but this is highly confusing and will not be used in musicmap.<br><br>The strength of Pop music lies in a denial of genre or niche: Pop does not try to bring a new subculture or convey a message. It wants to include anyone and everyone and just have fun. Pop wants to be approachable: no barrier, no threshold, no shame. Anything goes. But Pop should not be seen as a derogatory term: every person adores at least one Pop song, whether it’s Britpop, Synthpop, Disco Pop or whatnot. Pop after all, is not irreconcilable with innovation or quality. But what exactly defines Pop music then? Pop is whatever gets the most appeal from people, the common denominator between different music tastes and the most flexible, applicable of styles. Never too extreme in one aspect or another, yet never too mundane or boring; Pop seeks to catch the attention fast and hold it, but never in an offensive or disturbing way.<br><br>In the US, the repressive authority of the Bush administration on Dance/EDM parties in general has led since its inauguration in 2000 of a stronger intertwining of Dance, especially House, with other genres such as Rap, Nu R&B and Pop music. Electronic samples and the use of soulful vocals start to appear on EDM records that would otherwise be ignored. American EDM artists were forced to cross over to Pop in order to financially survive and this has led to an even greater diversity, complexity, and eclecticism in contemporary (Pop) music. After the Obama inauguration, “pure” EDM breaks through in the States, something that hasn’t happened since its birth in Chicago and Detroit. However, by that time, Pop, Dance, Rap, R&B, and Rock were already so clotted up (not the least by the advent of streaming music services and growing multimedia) that it might even be reasonable to discard Pop as a separate super-genre and regard it as simply a collection of the most popular and commercial music – just like it was in the beginning.<br>",

        "description": "Pop music is a commercial and <b>light variant of either Rock or R&B</b> music, often crossing over to whatever genre sells the most. However, before Rock music, producers were already creating Pop music. The dominant source of Pop in the early 20th century was <b>Tin Pan Alley</b>: a musical neighborhood in New York near and for <b>Broadway</b> (thus aimed at <b>musicals</b>). Nearby was the famous Brill Building. When EP’s became more and more commonplace in the fifties and the <b>first hit parade</b> appeared (in <b>1952</b>), this building turned into a giant busy hive, filled with countless <b>recording studios</b>. At first, Brill Building’s focus lay at creating music for the family, but that all changed in the late fifties. As a response to Rock ‘n’ Roll’s popularity,<b> professional Pop producer</b>s crafted <b>teen oriented hit songs</b>. Charming <b>male crooners</b> in the fifties and hired <b>girl groups</b> in the sixties were meant to express an irresistible image of sexiness, turning their work into large profits. The first crooners appeared in the twenties and were named after their singing technique of <b>gently moaning in the microphone</b>. A large difference with (poorer) hollers or shouters in Blues who had to use all the volume their voices could produce, as they had no voice amplification. Brill Building Pop evolved from a more minimal singer/songwriter type of music (early Tin Pan Alley pop music) into a light version of Rock ‘n’ Roll written in 6/8 signature with Latin or exotic sounds, strings, children’s melodies and Rhythm ‘n’ Blues influences. The most famous producer of this era is undoubtedly <b>Phil Spector</b>, who helped reach many Girl Groups and Golden Age Rock bands achieve stardom with his “<b>Wall of Sound</b>” recording technique.",

        "description": "Starting in 1967, Folk Rock slowly breaks loose from its predefined constraints and gives birth to perhaps the most <b>immortal</b> of music genres: Singer/Songwriter (S/SW). This marks a pivotal moment in music history: the artist in Pop music is no longer simply the performer of prewritten lines, but the author of them as well. By 1971 (not by chance at the start of the decade of <b>individualism</b>), the genre has fully taken form. <b>Personal stories and emotions</b> take precedence over social criticism and community feeling. Folk Rock provided wavering crooners with the confidence they needed to pursue <b>solo careers</b> and attain <b>artistic independence</b>. The essence of Singer/Songwriter lies in its lyrics: a revelation of inner thoughts in a <b>poetic</b> manner, often as <b>exposing</b> as possible. The accompaniment of these lyrics is also performed by the Singer/Songwriter, almost always with a <b>single guitar or piano</b>. During the early eighties, Singer/Songwriter leads with a series of <b>alternative subgenres</b> to Indie Pop & Rock, such as College Pop, Lo-Fi Pop, Neo-Folk and later Slowcore. Other subgenres are either dependent on the type of song (function) or the region (sentimental <b>ballads</b>, reactionary protest songs, Dutch <b>Kleinkunst</b>, smooth poplike <b>Bleakfolk</b>, Soft Rock as proto S/SW…) In France, the most important subgenre known as <b>Chanson</b> (“Song”) already experienced a rich history during the entire 20th century. Chansons are even more emotional than usual and have a strong historical connection with French film, literature, and theater.",

        "description": "Power Pop, one of the first true Pop Rock genres, is in fact a <b>revival of Mersey Beat</b>, a second British Invasion so to speak. However, you can hear an important difference: the riffs are played with <b>short, energetic strokes</b>, enhanced by <b>fast, repetitive drum beats</b>. This property gives Power Pop a very ‘spikey’ and hyperactive feel, hence its name. The emergence of Power Pop and the early types of Pop Rock that went along with it, must be seen as <b>compensation for</b> the ‘<b>darker</b>’, more serious types of <b>Rock</b> (Pub Rock, Roots Rock, Mod) popping up in the UK in the early seventies. To steer the people (read: teens) as far away from these ‘bad’ types of Rock as possible, the sound of Power Pop went in the opposite direction: <b>happy, melodic and light</b>. At the end of the seventies, Power Pop experienced a <b>second wave</b>, and in the nineties a <b>third one</b>. The success of Disco and derivatives trumped Pop Rock’s second wave and strongly suppressed the genre in the eighties. The original fusion of Hard Rock and Mersey Beat (first wave) became tainted by other genres during these succeeding waves, leading eventually to dissolution into other genres, though a number of Power Pop artists are still active. Original Power Pop served as a blueprint for many later Pop Rock artists, which were drawn to the<b> bare simplicity of Classic Rock</b> without psychedelic influences or extensive post-production.",

        "description": "Some A.O.R. bands took a <b>lighter approach</b> (<b>no guitar solos</b> and less bass) and created Soft Rock (though sometimes the two genres are hard to separate). What started as an alternative countermovement became so commercial that eventually it was pure Pop music. Another break in A.O.R.’s trend is the stepping of more <b>solo</b> and singer/songwriter artists into the spotlight instead of faceless bands. The outcome and legacy of A.O.R. was a large and soft genre, yet not targeted at teens (compared to other Pop), but specifically <b>for adults</b>: Adult Contemporary (which can be seen as a synonym for Soft Rock). The name Adult Contemporary did not start out as a genre but as a <b>billboard category</b> for music, officially installed in 1979. Adult Contemporary (or A.C.) replaced the Easy-Listening category, and as such it is rather <b>lightweight</b> music for more <b>mature people</b> who like their music <b>relaxing</b> and <b>politically correct</b>. The term A.C. got retrospectively applied to all kinds of Soft Rock, even before 1979. Unsurprisingly, there is quite some <b>overlapping</b> with similar genres such as Country Pop, Smooth Jazz, New Age and Singer/Songwriter. In the eighties, a small, sentimental, “sophisticated” subgenre emerged, known as <b>Sophisti-Pop</b>. Sophisti-Pop uses more synth than regular Soft Rock, though subdivision within the eclectic style of Soft Rock is a bit hair splitting. Adult Contemporary is still being broadcasted on specialized radio channels throughout the world, as these golden Pop Rock <b>classics</b> seem to have a <b>timeless</b> appeal.",

        "description": "It was only a matter of time before the New Wave movement would spin out of control. At the far end of the spectrum (the final stage) was Hi-NRG (= <b>high energy</b>): a type of Disco/Synthpop where there was absolutely no trace of Rock left to find. This was pure Pop music: <b>slickly produced Synthpop</b> melodies driven by the pulsing rhythm of <b>drum machines</b>. Over-the-top, <b>decadent</b> and ecstatic <b>Post-Disco-Proto-House</b> indulged in a world of fashion, <b>discotheques</b> and upper class style and heavily associated with <b>homosexual</b> parties. Hi-NRG, Eurodisco or <b>Electro-Disco</b> is much <b>faster</b> and more <b>high-pitched</b> compared to regular Disco. There’s also very <b>little bass</b>, but a constant repetitive rhythm made futuristic by <b>modulations</b>. The most well-known Eurodisco song is <b>Giorgio Moroder</b>’s “I Feel Love’ (sung by Donna Summer) and it was far ahead of its time. It would take almost five years before the genre would unfold, but Moroder had already sown the seeds of all Dance music to come.<br><br>A specific trademark of Hi-NRG was the ‘<b>megamix</b>’: ultralong edits consisting of different songs mixed together to create a <b>non-stop dancing machine</b>. Megamixes were made possible by the introduction of the 12” LP single, allowing longer tracks to be released on single. These mixes showcased producers who became the very first electronic dance <b>DJ’s</b>.<br><br>Hi-NRG or Eurodisco is a surprisingly large genre with many subgenres. Italy developed the biggest and most familiar subgenre of Hi-NRG: <b>Italo-Disco</b>, full of <b>silly melodies and lyrics</b> that gave new meaning to the word “catchy”. France took a more futuristic and instrumental approach with <b>Space Disco</b>. And then there is <b>Eurobeat</b>: hyperfast Italo-Disco with a much stronger beat, developing in the late eighties, gaining much popularity in Japan, and forming a bridge towards Eurodance.",

Commercial Dance Pop (often consisting of<b> girl groups</b>) is also prominent while an escapist, minimal type of Synthpop known as <b>Technopop</b> in Japan, accompanies perfectly Japan’s Zen philosophy. Japan has always had an incredibly broad interest in foreign popular music and is known for demanding special <b>Japan-distributed albums</b> of well-known artists with more songs than the original.<br><br>In <b>South Korea</b>, a large shockwave of new popular culture across the country known as “<b>Hanryu</b>” dramatically changed the musical landscape in the last decades. Sometimes the term is also applied to Korean New Wave music, yet in a much broader meaning of the genre. Out of this music, pure<b> K-pop</b> emerges as an extremely <b>fashion- and image-oriented, boysband/girlsband Electrodancepop</b>. With the advent of music streaming and social media, K-pop became massively popular and Korea’s <b>biggest export product</b>. Its <b>sexual subcontext</b> is well placed in a country where perfection of appearance and online lifestyle is rule, not exception.",

        "description": "If every reaction has a “re-reaction”, then Britpop is the <b>re-reaction to Grunge</b> (since Grunge was a reaction itself against Glam Metal). Enough with all the feeble, depressing sorrow and back to glamorous Rock! This <b>soft but catchy</b> kind of Pop is sometimes credited as the least original genre of the nineties. On an auditory level there is indeed not much shocking: a clear wink to British (of course) <b>Mersey Beat</b> but <b>roughened up</b> by the presence of Indie Rock, with sometimes synthesizers and electronic effects to cast a certain <b>glam mood</b>. What makes the genre so well-known, popular and clearly defined is not its sound then, but the Rock ‘n’ Roll mentality of it: the <b>cocky attitude</b> of British frontmen determined to conquer the stage, <b>steal the show</b> and awe the masses. There is a reason for such attitude: many British bands were fed up with the overall dominance of American Rock bands in the British hit charts of the early nineties (mostly due to Grunge). As such they created a strong <b>anti-American</b> music genre, with a very narrow range of influences (all British). Of course, the sound, vocals and song structure are all means to this end. Which explains why Britpop is same meat, different gravy, but very attractive.",

The <b>Live Aid concert </b>in 1984 for example (one of the biggest concerts of all time) is a pivotal moment.

Thus, Dance Pop is the <b>fusion of</b> Dance (mostly <b>House</b>) <b>with Pop</b> and is not the same as Disco-Pop or Urban Pop, though a large amount of overlapping is fairly common in the eclectic world of Pop music, where sell value presides over genre integrity. Most Dance Pop artists are <b>girlsbands or boysbands</b>, the epitome of capitalistic Pop. <b>Choreographed</b> ensembles of young girls or boys create an illusion of identification by having a different stereotypical personality, but all aimed at one thing: <b>selling sex</b>. More than ever before, Dance Pop marketed itself to young teens (whether male or female) with the sex-appeal of barely older artists. In Dance-Pop, the music is far more important than the lyrics, which only serves as <b>catchy sing-along phrases</b>.<br><br>Besides girlsbands, boysbands and Dance Pop soloists, a new wave of Eurodance artists started to make an <b>incredibly poppy and lightweight</b> version of Eurohouse at the end of the nineties, ushering in the end of the genre.

        "description": "Electropop can be used as a comprehensive term encompassing all forms of Electronic or synthesizer-used Pop. In its narrow definition, it is the latest development of<b> dominant mainstream and dance-oriented</b> Pop music.<br><br>If Dance Pop is the Disco-influenced mainstream music of the eighties and nineties, then Electropop is the Electro-influenced mainstream music of the nillies and tens. The word “Electro” here concerns the combination of both <b>Electroclash</b> (and thus Synthpop indirectly) <b>and Electro-House</b>. Particularly the latter is important, as it has introduced <b>low frequency synth sounds</b> in Electropop, often in a <b>rough, distorted</b> manner. This makes Electropop a lot <b>“nastier” and daring</b> than its predecessor Dance Pop, while also focusing on a <b>more mature</b> audience. A very small subgenre, <b>Wonky Pop</b>, was briefly popular at the end of the nillies, but being only defined by the use of “unstable” or “wonky” sounds in Electropop, it is hardly worth considering a true genre. By the turn of the millennium, all Disco and House elements in hit chart music were not fresh and contemporary anymore. Electroclash and later Electrohouse changed the focus in Pop from a warm R&B-type groove beat to a <b>crisper</b> sound with <b>higher dynamic range</b>. This has made the music somewhat less infectious compared to Dance-Pop, but more<b> eclectic and flexibl</b>e, thus able to reach an even larger audience.<br><br> Where Dance Pop was heavily steered out of a record label or producer’s perspective, Electropop artists take great pride in <b>own personality and personal touch</b>. Remarkable is the fact that almost all Electropop artists are <b>female vocalists</b>. Despite the fact that they are pushed forward nowadays by record companies due to a loyal idolizing female fanbase and a <b>seductive image</b> of sex to attract a male fanbase, they are all well-aware <b>entrepreneurs</b>: an interesting discrepancy with the historical dominance of male (puppet) crooners in Brill Building Pop. In a certain way, Electropop marks the end of an industry’s century-long hegemony, starting all the way with Tin Pan Alley: Pop Inc.",

        "description": "An enormous genre often forgotten in music genealogies is “Schlager”. The word is also synonymous with the type of song (“a Schlager”) and is German for <b>hit song</b> (to hit = schlagen). But the genre has a much greater reach than simply <b>Germany</b> and <b>Austria</b>. Neighboring countries <b>Netherlands</b> and <b>Belgium</b>, as well as former <b>Yugoslavian</b> countries and <b>Sweden</b> and <b>Finland</b> all have rich traditions of Schlager music. Its roots lie deep in traditional Folk music (particularly <b>town criers and troubadours</b>) but the style evolved into a more popular form of music starting as early as the thirties in some countries. Like troubadour songs, Schlagers are <b>emotional, sentimental ballads</b>, though often <b>superficial</b> in nature. They tell tales about <b>love, misfortune or happiness</b>, but always in a <b>conservative</b> and <b>politically correct</b> manner. After World War II and especially the Rock ‘n’ Roll revolution, Schlager singers went on the defense, as they felt threatened by this new type of popular music. Since Blues, Jazz and Country had little influence in prewar Europe, the rise of Rock ‘n’ Roll was even a greater shock and of more significance there. Thus a much greater production of Schlagers saw the light, produced in a <b>lightweight pop manner</b> with piano, guitar, <b>accordion or folk instruments</b>. Each country has its own history and differences when it comes to Schlager, but the common thread outlined here stretches outside borders. Schlager remains an undying genre, alive in many “folky” bars, community centers, or at huge <b>Schlagerfestivals</b>.",

    "description": "For many non-Americans unfamiliar with the music, Country feels like a small and insignificant genre. However, Country has been the United States’ most selling genre for several decades and still is among the top selling categories according to numerous statistics. During the seventies, American citizens could even tune in to more than 600 (!) different Country radio stations. The genre has always been closely linked with radio and was one of the first music genres to go on the airwaves and into the living room of many Americans. Because that’s what Country is all about: everyday life, family, home. It is no coincidence many Country bands are named as a family and/or are actual families. Strong family values form a common theme throughout Country’s history, but sometimes a darker reality of liquor, drugs, adultery and criminal behavior dispels that picture perfect illusion. Then, such a predicament becomes a catalyst that creates diversity within the genre. But Country deals about more than just family. God and the motherland form two other recurring core values of Country’s content. The lyrical subject of faith has created a link with Gospel (Country Gospel), and a distance with people of other religions.<br><br>Being as old as it is, Country works mostly with very classic (string) instruments: banjo, fiddle, acoustic guitar, violin and harmonica. The genre has refrained during later decades from incorporating many other instruments, especially electronic ones. With a slow tempo and a sparse (often acoustic) set-up, Country puts great emphasis on voice. Many male and female Country singers are renowned for their voice, perhaps the most important instrument of the genre. Just like Folk Rock, the voice should have the power to convey emotional stories or ballads. Duets, especially man and woman talking about love, are also common within the genre. Country is based on traditional ballads or tunes with rather plain melodies and chords, similar to Folk music (which was an important influence on the genre).<br><br>Because Country can be traced back to remote, wild, rural areas, the name is a reminder of its geographical origin. But Country quickly conquered the urban landscape, like Nashville, Tennessee, where the mythical Grand Ole Opry dance hall showcased all kinds of Country genres every week from 1925 until this very day. The word “Country” also hints at the patriotism embedded in Country’s subculture. A strong link with American culture and the pride of the nation give Country a strong domestic appeal, but a weak foreign one. However, certain Country songs and artists have become immensely popular overseas and show just how much power and emotion can be transferred throughout the genre.<br><br>A particular aspect of Country is that it is sometimes regarded as the Caucasian equivalent of the Blues - the music of one stereotypical image: the common, traditional, Christian, American man. The two primordial billboard music categories left no doubt about this: popular music was either “race music” (made by blacks: Blues and black Jazz) or “hillbilly music” (made by whites: Country). Country subculture can be conservative and is sometimes accused of homophobic or racist incidents such as worshipping of the southern – slave - Confederacy. Yet the genre is far too broad and rich to narrow it down to its most politically extreme exponents. There were also succesful black musicians.<br><br>A possible subdivision is the use of generations because Country is so family related. These (six) generations are often real family generations (famous Country singer Hank Williams and his almost equally famous son Hank Williams Jr. for example). The first and second generation are sometimes known as “Traditional Country”. The hegemony of Rock within white music culture prevents a large mainstream breakthrough of Country, especially on an international scale. But the unique and powerful characteristics of the genre grant Country still a strong appeal, almost a century long.",

It evolved as an <b>introvert</b>, back-to-the-roots music that wasn’t happy at all, and often involved <b>tragic ballads</b>, known as Honky Tonk. Most Honky-Tonk songs deal about relationship problems, alcohol abuse, financial worries or other misfortune.

Honky Tonk artists often sang with a thick, <b>southern tongue</b> and in a <b>nasal tone</b>. Combined with cowboy hat, boots, and costume, the caricature of the traditional Country singer was complete.

        "description": "Hillbilly Country evolved into something completely different in the forties. A lot of focus was put on the <b>strings</b>, which were <b>fiercely fiddled</b>, to create another type of Classic Country, called Bluegrass. Bluegrass took its name from one of the first practicing bands: Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys, who in their turn were named after the state <b>Kentucky</b> aka “the Bluegrass Country”. Bluegrass is that typical, atmospheric, <b>hi-pitched, hyperactive</b> country most people know. <b>Violins</b> are very common, alongside mandolin, guitar and banjo. Although Bluegrass sounds like it’s not taking itself seriously, it is actually very <b>reactionary</b> and serious music, rising up against authority. Bluegrass is more zealous than other country genres, spreading forth revolution and <b>highly religious messages</b>, like a musical crusade. A bit like political Folk music one could say, but with a certain <b>supercharged overdrive</b>. Bluegrass swears off electric instruments and is always <b>completely acoustic</b>, like Folk. Improvisation or <b>freewheeling</b> is also a key Bluegrass element.<br><br>The genre remained popular and even got some small subgenres, such as the progressive <b>Newgrass</b> in the seventies. The film “Oh Brother Where Art Thou” by the Coen Brothers in 2003 also created a strong reinterest in Bluegrass (and Country in general) during the nillies.",

    "name": "RHYTHM 'N' BLUES",
    "supergenre": true,
    "description": "Like the name implies, Rhythm ‘n’ Blues (“R&B” or “RnB”) is the powerful combination of two old music genres. Gospel (the Rhythm) on one hand, which provides an infectious groovy tempo that was already noticeable in its early barbershop days with handclapping and rhythmical vibrating voices. Blues on the other hand, which delivers warm chords and rich bass. “Gospel & Blues” combines diverse musical elements and is therefore a highly flexible hybrid genre, forming a bridge between many super-genres. R&B can be the middle ground between Blues and Rock, but also between Rap and Pop or Gospel and House, which makes it one of the most accessible music genres.<br><br>The cornerstone aspect of all R&B is the backbeat: the 2nd and 4th beat of each bar becomes accentuated, creating a strong cadence. Backbeat makes R&B highly danceable, eventually leading to Disco and the concept of nightlife dance culture and clubbing. R&B is also known for more complex rhythms and drums; the introduction of the breakbeat or a high emphasis on percussion. Instrumentation follows out of the basic Blues set-up: guitar, bass, and drums. Yet almost always one or more instruments are added, selected by their ability to create a richer sound and radiate a warm, cozy feeling: violins, synth, vibraphone, Hammond organ, or brass horns.<br><br>Although R&B is rather a diverse collection of genres, the common themes of optimism, love and joy recur in all of them. A positive vibe, amplified by invigorating performances by artists with a charismatic, radiant appearance, makes R&B among the most popular of genres. Such joy is a clear rupture with R&B’s predecessor, Blues. Some smaller exceptions (Early R & B, Doo Wop) and one big one (Disco) put aside, all R&B can be divided into three strong families even more known than R&B itself: Soul, Funk and Urban.<br><br>Soul is a secular and more pop oriented continuation of Gospel: gentle and emotional songs (usually about love) with high production values but even more benevolent willpower. Soul actually refers to a personal quality of high morality: a Soul person is a righteous being. Soul was the dominant mainstream music genre in the first half of the sixties and remained popular ever since. With multiple subgenres and three revivals (Neo-Soul, Vintage Soul Revival, and Future Soul), it is clear to see that Soul’s strength has barely diminished.<br><br>Funk evolves out of Soul but reaches out to Jazz and a bit of Rock to create even more rhythmical music, based on a single chord. Funk brings a repetitive pulsing groove around which every song is built, making the genre more dance-friendly than Soul. Funk likes to use electric bass or electro synth distortions to create a “greasy” sound, while the percussion section is hardly distinguishable from the melody or bass section: all the instruments have become one - the Funk groove. The word funk is derived from old slang for the smell of sex: enough said. Many Funk subgenres have emerged and recent revivals prove an undying popularity, although Funk has never been mainstream nor underground: it knows exactly how to stay on the edge of the spotlights. Something that could not be said of Disco: a blend of Funk and Soul that takes over the entire popular music scene in the late seventies.<br><br>Urban is the latest development of R&B, where it blends with Rap, Pop and a bit of Latin into a fusion that should function equally well for nightclubbing, album sales, live concerts or radio performances. Therefore Urban has become a very dominant music genre and often criticized for commercialism and shallowness. The word urban comes from the “Urban Contemporary” radio format, where the latest forms of R&B are played that are the most suitable for going-out (in city clubs, hence urban). As a result of Urban’s popularity, the general term R&B became synonymous with Urban and for many (young) people, these two genres are misinterpreted as one and the same. But real Rhythm ‘n’ Blues is an immensely large and diverse music family: a lineage with a tremendous passion and respect for its own productions, and usually with an almost obligatory request to get up and move.",

        "description": "(Jump) Blues dramatically changed when the band stopped being an anonymous whole but received a <b>face</b>: the frontman, the <b>singer/songwriter</b>. The moment <b>black musicians</b> stepped forward with their own music, driven by a <b>powerful and driven backbeat</b>, it quickly was discarded as something vile, not meant for “decent, white people”. The previous term for R&B, “<b>Race Music</b>”, already made that very clear. Race Music was a Billboard category reserved for Blues music, as Jazz and Gospel also featured white musicians. Such outspoken racism was put to a halt in 1948, with the replacement of the term by “Rhythm and Blues”, abbreviated as R&B. Thus at first R&B was seen as synonymous with Blues, but it quickly developed into a separate style. <br><br>True R&B (from the forties, as the term received a new meaning at the end of the century) had <b>very few instruments</b>, similar to <b>Gospel</b>. Melodies became shorter and more repetitive like riffs, and a <b>steady backbeat</b> is omnipresent. Despite sparse instrumentation, R&B focused on an infectious rhythm, like a proto-groove. With more <b>emphasis on albums, performance and singer personality</b> than ever before, the birth of Rhythm ‘n’ Blues must be acknowledged as a milestone in the evolution of popular music. It creates the concept of high-profile singers with personal music, who combine their songs on albums in order to reach large audiences. And when finally white singers start reshaping R&B in the form of Rock ‘n’ Roll, few realized that they witnessed the shape of grand things to come.",

        "description": "Doo Wop is an often neglected, but familiar and characteristic genre. It’s being performed by <b>girl or boy groups</b> that sing in<b> vocal harmony</b>: one person sings lyrics while the others perform backing vocals in a polyphonic symphony of <b>gibberish</b> and mumbling, humming <b>sounds</b> or <b>onomatopoeias</b> (like “Doo Wop”, hence the name). Sometimes Doo Wop features no instruments at all, it can be purely <b>a cappella</b>; a step further in the already modest instrumentation of Rhythm ‘n’ Blues. But Doo Wop can just as easily feature a supporting band or accompanying instrument on top of its barbershop group. However, this minimal set-up was for most Doo Wop artists not a choice: they were <b>so poor</b> that they couldn’t afford any instruments. And while many of them wandered around in <b>New York</b> city, hoping for a glimpse of fortune and fame, only <b>very few succeeded</b>. The ones that did, had the joy of their success resonating in their music. In its <b>smooth, warm</b>, cheerful sound (a sort of <b>peaceful</b> post-war happiness), one can already distinguish the yet-to-come embrace of Soul. Doo Wop has experienced <b>revivals</b> in subsequent decades and influenced in subtle ways a number of cross-genre songs.",

        "description": "A lot of things had changed in 1959 since the ascent of R&B around 1943. It was a year of great opportunities and <b>hope</b>. In the southern and middle states of USA, black R&B musicians threw R&B, Gospel, Blues, and a bit of Country into a big<b> melting pot</b>. They were cooking something that was quite <b>slow</b> but also <b>raw</b> and <b>emotional</b> at the same time. This <b>Rural</b> aka Deep aka Memphis Soul became well known under the leading record company’s name: <b>Stax</b>, granting the name Stax Soul. Memphis Soul was not only the first kind of Soul, but also the most <b>independent</b> one. Musicians wrote their own music - straight from the heart - instead of producers or songwriters. The lyrics were often based on their experiences during the so called “<b>Soul Circuit</b>”: a trail in southern USA almost all Soul artists followed, with a high degree of love, sex and liquor along the way.<br><br>Deep Soul tracks are recognizable by their <b>low tempo</b>, the use of <b>clipped guitar</b>, and a <b>lo-fi production</b> compared to other Soul. The latter two characteristics also show a gradual evolution towards Funk, the immediate successor of Deep Soul. When the music caught on in the UK, it was renamed as Southern Soul. <br><br>The genre rose greatly alongside national <b>black awareness</b> in the sixties, thanks to the <b>civil rights movement</b> and Martin Luther King. Southern Soul was the voice of black <b>pride</b>, but it wasn’t reactionary nor intimidating. Soul does not try to combat it opposes, instead it tries to disarm. Soul vocalists honor the Gospel tradition of forgiveness and harmony. The music is <b>hopeful, warm</b> and portrays <b>intense</b> stories about <b>love</b> and heartbreak that still sound sincere after all these decades. ",

        "description": "After the rural areas, Soul quickly caught on in the <b>urban</b> areas, where it lost a bit of that rural roughness (just as happened with Country). First almost immediately in <b>Chicago</b> (Chicago Soul) and a bit later in the motor city: <b>Detroit</b>. These urban types of Soul were more <b>uptempo and happy</b> than usual (i.e. Southern Soul could sometimes be tragic). The experimental melting pot was turned into a <b>factory-produced popular recipe</b>: a strong backbeat, a <b>bouncy</b>, melodic <b>bassline</b>, <v>four part harmony vocals</v> (often female), a tight snare drum, and usually tambourines. It was heavily produced, <b>polished</b> music, especially by that record company that became so well known that its name is a synonym for the genre: <b>Motown</b>. Compared to Chicago Soul, Detroit Soul has more an “industrial” sound and production, and is a lot more <b>danceable</b>. Motown’s rhythm sections (drum + bass or tambourine) were all very uniform but thoroughly contemplated. Chicago and Detroit Soul became exceptionally popular with <b>both black and white </b>audiences (hereby connecting the two cultures), whereas Memphis Soul was purely black oriented. <br><br>In the UK, the <b>B-sides</b> of Motown records became popular as <b>Northern Soul</b>. Northern Soul is not really a separate genre. It started as a sales pitch to sell Motown to North-British youth, but soon exploded into a <b>Rave-like subculture</b> of wild parties, where the most dance-friendly, lesser-known Detroit Soul tracks were hunted and played from dusk till dawn.",

        "description": "Soul was very popular and melodic, but it wasn't really daring or <b>danceable</b>. After a while, artists started looking at Rock and Jazz for new elements. They preferred the <b>psychedelic</b>, rebellious nature of Acid Rock alongside the deep, <b>dynamic</b> part of Soul Jazz as flavours of choice for the revolutionary fusion that was Funk. <b>James Brown</b>, nicknamed “the hardest working man in show business”, spearheaded the evolution from Soul to what became known as <b>Funk Soul</b> and eventually Funk. But Funk's development was already tangible in the <b>Swamp Funk</b> of New Orleans from the forties, influenced by Louisiana creole. <br><br>Funk places strong <b>emphasis on the first beat</b> of each bar while the rest of the rhythm constantly changes, like an early form of breakbeat. This is known as “<b>The Rhythm of the One</b>” (the one beat, instead of four or two). All instruments work together to enhance this feeling. Percussion becomes accentuated by short, <b>monotone riffs, slapping bass</b>, brass instruments, and accents on synth/piano to create what is known as “<b>the groove</b>”: the pulsing force behind each Funk song. Some bands, starting with Parliament and Funkadelic, introduced a<b> more spacey and less syncopated sound</b>, known as P-Funk.<br><br>Yet Funk does not try to blend all instruments into a carefully assembled and produced whole (like Soul) but it maintains their individuality to create a more <b>organic sound</b>. Funk tries to sound like primal energy or biological essence. Another difference with Soul is that Funk revolves less around songs and albums: the music is one continuous melting pot, where <b>live performance and technical expertise</b> are valued over touching lyrics and record production. The <b>Apollo Theatre</b>, New York, was such a place where many Funk artists blew the audience away with their virtuoso and vigorous performances.",

As pure <b>ecstasy music</b>, with no worries, Disco was all about having fun, sex, and dancing in the <b>disc-o-theques</b>: a new type of nightlife place, such as the infamous club <b>Studio 54</b> in New York. What made these places and Disco groundbreaking, was the arrival of the very first continuous dance music: the <b>genesis of the mix</b>.<br><br>Like many revolutionary genres, Disco was the outcome of a synergetic concurrence of events. On one hand, the use of <b>12” records for singles</b> allowed deeper grooves, and therefore better sound quality and harder beats; a must for later House records. On the other hand, the <b>end of the Vietnam War</b> in <b>1975</b>, marked a moment of joy despite the actual loss of the war by the US. Yet the people had every reason to celebrate. Their protest had won, not the whims of a war-mongering government they did not support. Disco <b>celebration</b> - the pressure release after a decade of counterculture and protest - was without limits. Colorful dresses, <b>afro-wig</b> haircuts, <b>disco balls</b>, glitter, glamour, loose-fitting legs: all typical Disco elements that became popular, especially during the more commercial period of Disco in the late seventies. Before this, Disco was a <b>careful evolution of Funk</b> (“<b>Disco Roots</b>”) in exclusive parties by professional producers/DJ’s such as Francis Grasso and David Mancuso, starting in 1972.

        "description": "Make no mistake, this genre has nothing to do with Swing. On the contrary, New Jack Swing (NJS) is the updated continuation of the Philadelphia Sound: the body of Philly Soul in a brand new jacket of Rap. <b>Strong, funky breakbeats</b> no longer form the rhythm for messages of protest or gangster lyrics, but for <b>smooth, harmonic vocals</b> talking about love and romance. Although many (male) New Jack Swing artists seemed like <b>young, innocent casanovas</b>, they often had hidden gangster habits, preluding an era of East Coast Gangsta Rap. Swingbeat (a synonym for NJS) is exactly the way it sounds: extremely catchy and funky with strong emphasis on beat.<br><br>The TV-series “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” starring Will Smith knew how to bring New Jack Swing to a larger audience, featuring some of its songs alongside that particular late eighties New Jack Swing fashion: <b>loose Hip-Hop wear</b> with flashy colors, <b>round sunglasses</b>, female dreads or male <b>hightop haircuts</b>. But what makes this genre of particular gravity is the marriage of Rhythm ‘n Blues and Rap into Urban, a strong bond that has never fallen apart since.<br><br>New Jack Swing evolves into Urban Soul, but sometimes overlaps with it as well. New Jack Swing was already known as <b>Contemporary Soul</b> or Urban Soul before the rise of the latter, after all. ",

        "description": "During the nineties, Rhythm ‘n’ Blues started to cross over to many other popular genres, combined with a lyrical tendency towards shallow and popular content. Slowly the term R&B becomes a vassal for major record labels to ensure their profits, with Swingbeat as the first, careful step. <b>Independent artists</b> responded with a return to <b>pure, untainted Soul</b>. Especially female ones joined the cause, as a reaction to new R&B’s sexist or superficial approach.  Compared to older styles of Soul, this “Nu Soul” was <b>stripped down and simple</b>: only one singer instead of vocal harmonies, and not too many instruments. Often there are influences from Jazz Rap or Progressive Rap, with whom it shares the desire to express <b>proud and honorable</b> black awareness.  Although Neo-Soul is inclined to a non-commercial stand, <b>production</b> is highly <b>polished</b> and its <b>diva stars</b> surely had little financial worries during the heydays.<br><br>While Neo Soul has faded nowadays, a <b>return to Soul of the sixties</b> conquers more and more radio airspace in the nillies.

Out of the popular <b>Rap/R&B hybrid</b> of New Jack Swing, a new hybrid gradually unfolds, bursting to life in 1998: real Urban Soul or the first wave of Nu R&B. <b>Female</b>, predominantly black artists changed New Jack Swing’s uptempo Hip-Hop sound to a <b>slower, Soul infused ballad</b> (but still much faster than regular Soul).

Because Funktronica is influenced by <b>Italo-Disco</b> too, it shares much resemblance with Nu-Disco. Both genres signify a magical <b>junction</b> right in the center <b>between Eurodisco, Chicago House and Electro Funk</b>. After a long era of “cold” and “heartless” Electro-House, Nu-Disco and Funktronica become welcomed with open hands.

    "description": "The very first popular music genres came from a variety of influences but the foundations were laid in the United States. Before Blues and Jazz developed themselves, a number of “proto-genres” responsible for that development, were already known and popular throughout the country: Ragtime, Stride, Jug Bands, and Skiffle. But the most important one was Gospel. Gospel evolved from the fragile voice from black slaves into an undeniably huge genre with many subgenres. Gospel shakes off pretty fast its racial dimension: black and white join hand in hand to sing the song of God. Because Gospel is more about faith than about race; about believing in a better world and future and connecting different souls.<br><br>As Gospel expands and diversifies, questions are raised about the integrity of some artists and the music itself. Are some in it for the money or do they really speak the word of the Lord? Nowadays, Gospel is rarely a part of mainstream music media but without it, there would be no Rhythm ‘n’ Blues or perhaps even no popular music at all. However, in many churches and religious communities (especially in the southern part of the US) Gospel lives on strongly and is heavily produced, sung and experienced in sermons that induce ecstatic bliss in listeners, the likes other subcultures have never seen.<br><br>Though Gospel is already eclectic on its own, almost every popular music genre – from Rap to Metal – has been reshaped into a Gospel subgenre. Therefore a precise definition of Gospel in a broad sense is lacking, but the genre has some characteristics. Vocals for example, are usually sung in a “call-and-response” manner: a legacy from old church sermons, where the priest sings one part and the choir responds that same part. Not to create a cappella backbeat rhythm (although it was), but simply because of the fact that most church attendants were illiterate. Early Gospel only had piano accompaniment. Percussion was achieved by voice and handclapping. However, one should not underestimate the amount of rhythm achieved in traditional Gospel, another key characteristic of the music. Other pioneering popular music genres work with whatever set-up they could find or afford; easy to produce instruments like banjo or sometimes rudimentary tools such as washboards, kazoos, or jugs.  Modern or contemporary Gospel draws cues from any genre and therefore works with a whole variety of instruments.<br><br>The word “gospel” comes from two Old English words: “good” (which lost a vowel and became misinterpreted for the word God) and “spel”, which means a story or a message. Thus gospel is actually the same word as godspel or goodspel: fortunate news. This etymology is quite interesting, because it transcends Gospel’s religious (and narrow) dimension: the music is first and foremost a bringer of good news, no matter what faith one has: a herald of joy. And this is the power of Gospel: Gospel gathers people together, incites a sense of community, and inspires to do good, to bring good and to feel good.<br><br>Gospel is frequently forgotten as a super-genre in music genealogies, pushed away by bigger and more dominant families such as Blues, R&B, or Jazz. The collection of Gospel music is substantial though, with countless artists – even today – connected by their Christian faith. However, Gospel has taken on so many forms and styles that a common ground besides the message is sometimes hard to find. As the oldest popular music genre - the matriarch – it should be no wonder that Gospel has changed substantially throughout the years, but it has survived for more than a century: an accomplishment other genres still have to achieve.<br><br>",

        "description": "An interesting fact about Popular Music is that it emerged out of <b>necessity</b> rather than being a form of art or expression. The earliest genres can be traced back as early as the 19th century, at a time when <b>slavery</b> of African people was still omnipresent in the United States. These first generations of <b>Afro-Americans </b>would often sing <b>songs during</b> their hard <b>labor</b>, inspired by the <b>native rhythms</b> of their home continent. Besides relieving a bit of the suffering, their worksongs also acted as a clever <b>communication tool for hidden messages</b>. Disguised as <b>rhythmical a cappella</b> music, worksongs allowed slaves to bypass overseer control. Worksongs aka “<b>hollers</b>” are characterized by <b>repetitive humming in canon</b>, and already make use of “blue notes”. The main influences of the very first popular music genre are African roots music, black Folk ballads and Jug bands.<br><br>Another, later example of putting the African musical heritage to “practical” use, are the <b>Negro-Spirituals</b>: <b>sung prayers</b> to offer a flicker of hope during whatever spare private time remained. Spirituals are much longer songs, with <b>loud, sharp and nasal lyrics</b>. Eventually these Spirituals blended with church hymns and became Gospel. <b>Racist minstrel shows</b> for white people got notice of this “Negro” music and started performing parodies. Ironically, these discriminating farces helped spread unknown black music culture throughout the land and thereby shaped Blues and Jazz.",

Because there were almost no instruments, the lyrics were obviously important, talking about nothing but <b>good news, hope, and bliss</b>. At the turn of the century, the first Gospel composition was created. By 1920 the term “Gospel songs” was first used, and they were practiced in <b>rural, southern America</b> by both black and white people (albeit in slightly different forms).

    "description": "Blues is almost as old as popular music itself. Its rich history streams through various genres, just like the Mississippi river carried musicians from Minneapolis to southern New Orleans. At first, Blues was dominantly associated with anything vice; it was regarded as the song of outlaws and criminals. But Blues must rather be seen as an outlet or cry for the people on the border of society: the poor, blind, unfortunate and particularly, the black. Blues before R&B was regrettably known as “race music”. Blues wins-over hearts because that’s where it comes from. It is sincere, but also blunt. No roses without thorns.<br><br>Early Jazz and Ragtime were bound to the city as they needed bars and other band members to thrive. They also usually needed large instruments like string bass or piano. These genres were more formal types of music, performed in a professional manner and requiring an audience. Blues was none of this. Blues musicians could travel and play anywhere with or without anyone. They were (and often still are) lone wolves in pursuit of happiness. However, happiness didn’t always come along that easily. If their music didn’t catch on, they tried their luck with gambling and often ended up losing everything. Many Blues artists tried their luck in the city, though it required a certain resourcefulness to keep heads above water here. Rent parties, thrown by migrating Blues and Jazz artists alike in order to pay the rent, helped spread Blues rapidly across many US cities.<br><br>Blues music (also known as Blue Music) is characterized by use of guitar, single at first and later complemented by drums and bass. Songs are written in an AAB rhyme, in harmonic sequences and onto a 12 bar 4/4 rhythm. Most recognizable about Blues is a progression of chords, in a call and response manner.  Chords also make use of blue notes: notes with an altered pitch. This gives Blues a typical melancholic, mournful sound, although for black musicians such connotation never existed.<br><br>The word Blues was already part of English language in the nineteenth century, describing a state of delirium tremens or depression associated with chronic alcohol abuse. As early blues musicians were often lonely men with a tragic or criminal history, addicted to liquor and drugs (cocaine in the early days), “the blues” was an everyday part of their life. In these substances they sought a cure for their blues. In their music they sought atonement for their deeds. It is often said that Blues is the opposite of Gospel: that the latter is the music of God, where the former is the music of the Devil.<br><br>The magnitude of Blues as a genre, has promoted a certain structural polarization: acoustic versus electric / modern versus classic / rural versus urban.  These pairs could have been separate super-genres, yet they are mere vague groups without clear boundaries. The rerelease of old 78rpm Blues records onto new 33rpm LP’s rejuvenated a strong interest in early acoustic Blues during the sixties; an interest that was further expanded by the popularity of acoustic Folk Rock. Alas, Blues was later pushed aside by its own children: Rock and R&B.<br><br>Sometimes contemporary Blues is mentioned as a subcategory, but as a genre it doesn’t really exist. There are virtually no sources clarifying it, nor can a cohesive definition be constructed. This is a very strange phenomenon, suggesting that Blues itself is as good as dead, being the only super-genre that hasn’t spawned a new genre in more than twenty years. In a way, contemporary Blues can be seen as a broad umbrella genre for all latest Blues musicians who do not fit into another genre. Usually the music is quite smooth, a bit pop-like, with jazzy electric guitars and a strong Blues Rock influence. Contemporary Blues illustrates a restless kind of Blues: music that does not really know where to go nor fits in. This pushes Blues even more into the role that made it popular in the first place - Blues is the sound of the howling underdog.",

        "description": "Country Blues means rural Blues; Blues far away from the city, at a time when there existed almost no popular music whatsoever. Country Blues did not evolve out of Country music: it was the other way around.  Therefore the only existing music besides Folk and Classical music at the time of Blues’s conception was Gospel. Almost automatically, Blues becomes the <b>antithesis of Gospel</b>. <b>Wandering black singers</b> who lost their faith due to <b>misfortune</b> slowly but steadily developed their personal, secular type of Gospel or more accurately: “badspel”, as there was little positive news for them to tell. At first they simply used (cheap) banjos, and later <b>bottleneck guitars</b> on which they liked to play <b>blue notes</b> while singing <b>AAB verses</b>.

Also known as <v>Vocal</v> or Female Blues, Classic Blues is a whole different story than Country Blues. Under the influence of <b>classy</b> Jazz musicians, Blues was reshaped into an upper class phenomenon played in theaters in the big city, and therefore regarded as a sort of vanguard of <b>urban</b> blues (albeit completely different in form). Instead of freewheeling male rebels in shady bars, the music was performed by well-dressed <b>female vocalists </b>on stage during <b>vaudevilles</b>.

        "description": "Inspired by Ragtime music, Blues got introduced to the <b>piano</b> by the end of the twenties, forming Piano Blues but better known as Boogie Woogie. Similar to Ragtime, left hand provided a steady bass and the right hand provided the treble counterpoint.  The result was a very <b>rhythmic, syncopated </b>Blues, much more uptempo and happy than usual. The piano also made it possible to add a <b>4/4 beat</b>, with accent on 2nd and 4th beat. Hence, Boogie Woogie introduced the <b>backbeat</b> into the world of music: a milestone of great significance. Boogie Woogie’s backbeat is called a <b>shuffle</b>, and it made people’s feet move everywhere.<br><br>Boogie Woogie formed the ideal relief after the Great Depression and epitomized music <b>removed of inhibition</b> following the <b>end of prohibition</b>. As a post-depression natural muscle stimulant, Boogie Woogie rapidly became the drug of choice in the thirties, and it wouldn’t take long before “<b>doing the boogie</b>” was a common phrase for <b>dancing</b> to this <b>hyperactive</b> type of Blues.<br><br>Of course, Boogie Woogie is or was often abbreviated to Boogie, but this is deliberately avoided here to not cause confusion with the other, unrelated genre Boogie. Another synonym for the genre – <b>Barrelhouse Blues</b> - is derived from a bar at the time where most of the music was played: a barrelhouse. In rather a “<b>loose</b>” <b>atmosphere</b> than a tight one, Barrelhouse Blues was extremely infectious. Of particular interest were the barrelhouses in New Orleans where Piano Blues evolved into <b>New Orleans Blues</b> during the forties, which laid one of the foundations for Funk.",

Slowly the genre developed during the thirties and forties, albeit in a much different way than what is usually referred to as Chicago Blues. What was originally a strictly acoustic, more reserved type of music, changed into a loud and angry son of a gun after World War II. <b>Postwar urban migration</b> skyrocketed in 1946 and brought different <b>types of rural Country Blues together</b> in the northern cities of the US (not only Chicago). Blues musicians from various backgrounds tried their luck in the big city, and ended up influencing each other. At first, the music was not that much different from Country Blues, but there was a <b>spawning pool</b> of talent where musicians could team up and learn from each other. Busy city neighborhoods and large house parties however, urged the need for louder music. The introduction of the <b>electric guitar</b> in the forties wasn’t just luck; it came right at the time it was most needed for the survival of urban Blues. <b>Amplified harmonicas, drums, amplified guitars</b> and <b>loud, raunchy vocals </b>suddenly gave Blues a heavily <b>modernized</b> sound.<br><br>Sometimes Chicago Blues is further divided into <b>West Side Blues</b> and <b>East Side Blues</b> (the names are self-explicatory), but these are rather obscure genres. Chicago Blues ushered in a new age for Blues, and has been arguably the most influential type of Blues ever since. But the revolutionary sound takes only partly credit; <b>fierce, raw, dynamic voices in vibrato</b> give Chicago Blues a much more aggressive and darker appearance than other Blues, like a caged monster breaking free from its chains.",

        "description": "Desperate times call for desperate measures. The seventies truly was a tragic decade for Blues, <b>losing</b> the majority of its <b>fans to R&B</b>. With a last-resort return to two different but highly popular old Blues genres, the tide could not really be turned but at least total engulfing was avoided. But while black fans fled the Blues scene, more and more white artists started to take an interest in Blues, and handpicked their favorite genres for personal restyling.<br><br><b>Texas Blues</b>, a <b>heavily guitar oriented</b> type of old Country Blues, and Chicago Blues, the golden age of Blues, both  became the subject of <b>revivals with strong influences from Rock</b>. These revivals were respectively named Texas Blues Rock and Modern Electric (Blues) aka New Chicago (Blues). Technically both genres involve the i<b>ntroduction of electric guitar and a Rock drum kit</b>, which created a sort of second wave of Blues Rock. This wave happened on a much smaller scale than the first one, but more <b>technically advanced</b>, and with a<b> harder sound</b>. Its strong popularity in southern USA has created a great degree of overlapping with Southern Rock.<br><br>Typical for these genres are loud, <b>wailing guitars with sustained high notes</b>, and - despite many middle class white artists - this has given rise to the nickname “<b>Ghetto Blues</b>”. A great <b>emphasis on guitar solos</b>, like cries from the ghetto, and a wilder-than-thou sound provide insight as to why, though it is far more likely to encounter Texas Blues Rock and Modern Electric at desolated truck stop bars than in urban ghettos.",

    "name": "JAZZ",
    "supergenre": true,
    "description": "Jazz is music performed by an ensemble of players, each (very) specialized and proficient in their respective instrument. The usual Jazz instruments are: trumpets, saxophones, clarinets, trombones, string-bass, and piano alongside drums and a jazz-guitar. The interaction between these players is crucial. Compared to Rock or Blues, Jazz musicians follow no completely predetermined scores. They have to “feel” what the others are about to play and how the music will evolve. Yes, there are chords and melodies forming an identifiable foundation for each song, but improvisation and instantaneous experimentation are never absent. In a way, true Jazz music can only be experienced live. Each performance is supposed to be different. Jazz therefore is part of a thriving nightlife subculture in (Jazz) bars all over the world. The difficult aspect of improvisation probably explains why Jazz of all the super-genres is the most (if not always) instrumental, experiments the least with sound effects and plays more with structure, patterns and rhythms, reminding us a lot of Classical Music.<br><br>Jazz provides an interesting combination of (lower class) African American folk music with (upper class) European amusement and classical music. As such, Jazz has never been as racially defined as Blues is and is undoubtedly laudable for bonding these subcultures. Jazz ensembles are divided in different sections: the rhythm section (bass, drums, and piano) provide a steady beat throughout the track, while the melody section (horns) plays the chorus altogether and afterwards separately with solo’s.<br><br>The precise origin of the word Jazz has been lost over the course of time. Three possible explanations exist, though none of them might actually be the truth. One suggests that the word is black slang for the ensemble. Another hypotheses tells us that its roots lie in an early Jazz band named “Razz” or an early musician named “Jazbo”. Or the name might also be slang for “Jasmine”, the most common perfume for prostitutes working in early twentieth century brothels (where Ragtime and Jazz developed).<br><br>The power of Jazz lies in its rich contrast: improvised versus predetermination, chaos versus control and light and gentle sounds versus sharp and shrill tones. Jazz is also unique in influencing many genres in a subtle manner. Although there are no immediate derivative genres coming from Jazz, countless ones have been influenced by it. Its unique concepts and instrumentation are versatile enough to transfer to the most diametrical of popular music genres.<br><br>Over the course of history, there have been attempts to divide Jazz into a small number of categories, which could have been super-genres in their own right. Names such as “Traditional or Post-Jazz”, “First, Second and Third Stream (Jazz)” have been viable options at one time or another, but hold barely any relevance in today’s styles of Jazz.  One possible way to structure this whole is by using two pivotal moments - the birth of Bebop and Fusion - to divide the whole into three time periods: Classic Jazz, Modern Jazz and Post-Jazz (aka Post-Fusion or Free-Bop).<br><br>In the mid-seventies Jazz gets strongly repressed and overshadowed by R&B. Many American Jazz musicians migrate to Europe, where funded Jazz festivals and Jazz bars in historical city centres thrive better than in the States (particularly in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe).  Currently, American Jazz education is on the rise, but general public interest has stayed off. Post-Jazz has therefore become a global and heavily dispersed phenomenon of a genre that once was the sound of a nation.",

        "description": "The very first type of Jazz was played in the <b>background</b> of <b>bars</b> (barrelhouses), <b>brothels</b>, and <b>cabarets</b> by a small band. It first appeared in New Orleans thanks to the <b>melting pot</b> present of Ragtime, Haïtian Folk, Creole Folk and Country Blues. New Orleans was not only home to <b>Dixieland marching bands </b>and a main port for <b>sea travel with Cuba</b>, but a former <b>French colony</b> as well. Cuban music, French music, and marching bands all heavily influenced Jazz, making it one of the most diverse musical stews. <br><br>The music was not rough and emotional like Blues, but <b>balanced</b> and <b>reserved</b>. The basic instrument ensemble for New Orleans Jazz is trumpet, clarinet and trombone; a very modest but complementary trio, filling all frequencies and improvising around each other. No instrument dominates: they all communicate and play out their melodies at each other in a <b>counterpoint</b> manner. The technique of counterpoint came into Jazz through Cuban <b>Contradanza</b> (or Habanera) music, which in turn came from French Contredanse. All three instruments also <b>improvise collectively</b> instead of separately, an important difference with later Jazz. Improvisation and experimentation were common in Jazz and stimulated by frequent <b>marihuana</b> use, as the drug was still legal in the U.S. during the 1910s and 1920s. <br><br>After a while, Jazz bands <b>expanded</b> and became performed by <b>white artists</b>, leading to a slightly different sound (more instruments) which is known as Dixieland Jazz, though the difference is negligible.

As the first true “<b>city Jazz</b>”, Chicago Jazz influenced (and got influenced by) many musicians, also Blues artists. Its importance however is rather modest compared to Chicago Blues. Where the <b>Windy City</b> proved beneficial in bringing different regional styles of Blues together, the upside for Jazz was more superficial as Jazz started primarily in one region. However, Chicago provided the possibility for numerous <b>young white artists</b> to come in contact with this unknown black music and alter it to a more <b>“European” sound</b>. Chicago Jazz has more <b>changes in composition</b>, includes <b>harmonies</b> and is <b>densely textured</b> with <b>many solos</b>. While the music became more convoluted, it also received a “windy” overhaul, with <b>cold, harsh and grouching sounds</b>, fitting for Chicago’s climate. The latter aspect has given Chicago Jazz the alias “<b>Hardcore Jazz</b>”. The genre remained somewhat popular, due to its stereotypical sound that combines the <b>hyperkinetic</b> with the <b>lunatic</b>. Because it is also one of the oldest Jazz genres, recordings are very <b>lo-fi</b>, adding to an already <b>comical nature </b>of Chicago Jazz, and often used much later in cartoons or slapstick films.

After all, the world had just experienced its biggest <b>financial crisis</b> ever, where suicide was not out of the ordinary. Sheltering in the frivolous yet deafening sound of Big Band Jazz, man and woman, <b>black and white alike</b>, gathered in parties to deny the cold reality outside and experience this new craze: Swing. <br><br>Swing started with Jazz bands of ten instruments, but soon <b>orchestras of 17 instruments</b> became the standard; one can see that the phrase “big band” is not exaggerated. The setup consists of <b>more reed and less brass</b> instruments. <b>String basses</b> are also added. The music is very <b>catchy</b>, with call and response tunes, <b>hooky riffs</b>, and a 4/4 beat that makes it hard to stand still. Swing songs are <b>highly structured</b> compared to other Jazz. First the melody is played by all instruments. Then comes the vocal part with solos after which the chorus comes, consisting mostly of high notes.<br><br>The music was accompanied by its own dance, also called “Swing” or “<b>swinging</b>”, which has remained popular ever since. Related dances, such as<b> Lindy Hop</b>, were (and are) also commonly applied to Big Band Jazz. Remarkably, Swing became <b>revived during the Second World War</b> for an even greater moment of escapism. While enemy forces were bombarding the outskirts of the city, people partied and danced their worries away on the tunes of Swing, which could only be described as a Kafkaesque spectacle.",

The <b>third stream</b> was reserved for the type of Jazz that was neither, but a <b>merging between Classical Music</b> (particularly Chamber music) <b>and Jazz</b>.<br><br>Experimentations between these two genres existed long before Modern Jazz, so it wasn’t until 1957 that composer Gunther Schuller coined this <b>ambiguous term</b>. The <b>quest for coexistence</b> between classical music and a popular genre that was partly defined in its non-classical properties (such as improvisation) proved to be a slippery slope. Third Stream Jazz is certainly not a strong subcultural movement, but more a<b> collection of experimental Jazz songs</b> over the course of time. Obviously Third Stream songs are more <b>intricate</b> with <b>longer and deeper progression</b> (thus “Progressive Jazz’) than other types of Jazz, but when the avant-garde of the sixties invented Free Jazz, Third Stream’s relevance shrunk to absolute zero. Now, classical composers could learn more from Jazz than the other way around.<br><br>As a response, Third Stream’s definition was broadened to include<b> crossovers to World Music</b>, yet it remains one of the lesser known Jazz genres. A different successor at the end of the fifties, <b>Modal Jazz</b>, improvises on a series of scales instead of chords. Like the “Math Rock of Jazz”, Modal Jazz is defined (solely) by its highly technical, rational and mathematical structure.",

        "description": "Genres that grow too big eventually will fall. This was no different with Swing. Not only became it difficult to maintain such large, expensive orchestras, but more and more white people were copying the music. Though Jazz had always been less racially restricted than Blues, a number of black Jazz musicians felt a need to redefine <b>black Jazz culture</b> with a new, radical genre: Bebop. Their dissatisfaction is reflected in Bebop’s trademarks: <b>frantic, chaotic and aggressive</b>.<br><br>Bebop (or simply “Bop”) is one of the most <b>revolutionary</b> types of Jazz (and music). Why? Because it makes the music <b>faster by making it slower</b>. How? By stretching (thus slowing down) the tempo, a lot of <b>silent gaps</b> opened up between the beats. This free space could be filled in freely (<b>improvised</b>) with drum <b>rolls</b>, rhythmic <b>breaks</b> and <b>superfast, harmonic melodies</b>, usually in <b>vibrato</b>. Musicians also regularly imitate trumpet solos with their voice, leading to a new, fast singing technique called “<b>scatting</b>”. The word “bebop” itself comes from scatting, as it is as an often used <b>onomatopoeia</b>. The difference between Jazz from the past was so huge, that people eventually coined the term “<b>Modern Jazz</b>”, which later also included other experimental genres such as Hard Bop and Free Jazz.<br><br>Many wannabe Bebop musicians went downhill because they wrongly believed that <b>heroin</b>, which was very cheap during the forties, was an inherent part of Jazz culture.

Cool Jazz is mostly performed by white artists, with more influences from “white music” such as classical music. The genre experienced an early demise, lacking the passion and emotion of other (black) Jazz genres. Be that as it may, Cool Jazz remains the stereotypical background music for <b>sophisticated jazz bars</b> where intellectuals hold philosophical conversations till the wee hours of the morning.",

Hardbop is a more <b>modern evolution of Bebop</b>, but not particularly “harder”, despite the term. The music is <b>smoothened out</b> and more <b>emphasis</b> is being put <b>on the rhythm</b>. The “Cool School” of the west coast had also provoked a certain disdain by Bebop players, with its exaggerated rationalism and lack of pathos. Hardbop formed the <b>emotional answer</b> but it in a very<b> basic and gentle</b> manner and not chaotic at all. Alongside these influences, the arrival of <b>longplay records</b> (at 33rpm) allowed for longer songs and longer solos. Numerous <b>alternating solos and chords</b> (of different instruments, sometimes even bass and drums) are being played in a <b>call and response manner</b>. Hardbop is played by small ensembles and is often described as heaving a more “bodied” or “textured” sound. Since its inception, Hardbop has been the <b>dominant genre</b> in Jazz. When Jazz is performed in Jazz bars or performances, it is highly likely to be Hardbop. There are two Hardbop subgenres: <b>Funky Jazz</b> (simple, with bluesy sound) and <b>Mainstream Hardbop</b> (more complex, closer related to Bebop).",

As such, an offshoot of Fusion known as Smooth Jazz, became the favorite <b>puppet of</b> Jazz-related <b>record companies</b>, more profit-fixated than before. Experimentality became replaced by <b>radio friendly</b>, easy-listening music. Smooth Jazz aka <b>Pop Jazz</b> is supposed to sell - en large - with a slick, heavily<b> produced and</b> of course <b>smooth sound</b>. Jazz’s commercial direction is a striking part of the seventies “me generation”, where capitalist yuppies replaced naïve hippes. Of all different Jazz genres, it’s one of the <b>plainest</b>, with only <b>one or two instruments</b> playing melodies. Often there’s a <b>saxophone</b>, which is characteristic for Smooth Jazz’s (unintentional) <b>erotic connotation</b>: the music genre was a staple in erotic films or scenes during the late seventies and early eighties. After this period, Smooth Jazz also sparked reinterest in soft Pop music and paved the way for New Adult Contemporary (N.A.C). Critics, especially fans of classic and complex Jazz genres like Bop, describe Smooth Jazz as <b>cheesy and predictable</b>. Derogatory genre names like “<b>Fuzak</b>” and “<b>Hot Tub Jazz</b>” (New Age Jazz) reassert their opinions, while also holding a certain ground.  After all, Smooth Jazz is often catered as <b>background music</b> for bars or restaurants or just to relax at home.

Nevertheless, Nu-Jazz differs radically from older Jazz genres in means of production (<b>solo and recorded</b> versus live and in band) and its electronic sound.

    "description": "Jamaican music is regrettably often reduced to its most popular export Reggae. Reggae’s international appeal quickly surpassed the threshold which defines world music. This becomes very clear when compared to the music of neighbouring countries like Cuba and Haiti. But there are more Jamaican music genres that all have become more popular than world music. What is even more important than their popularity is the fact that Jamaican music creates a critical shackle between Rock, Rap and Dance. Almost all Jamaican music genres share certain characteristics which not only give them a very distinguishable sound but also explain the tremendous influence on other genres, particularly British ones. As Jamaica used to be a British colony until 1962 (which is after the rise of Ska), the import of Jamaican music into the UK has always been thriving (like the cargos from the infamous Trojan record label for example).<br><br>Jamaica had no radio stations at all let alone music television. The only way for Jamaican public to enjoy music they didn’t have to buy themselves, was by attending local “sound systems”: very large, mobile stereo systems with different types of speakers and turntables. To supply these sound systems with records, there were recording studios everywhere.  Therefore, Jamaican music is focused on recording, not performing. Live gigs were virtually non-existent and vinyl reigned supreme.  It is no wonder that many pioneering recording and loudspeaker techniques were invented in Jamaica. Because of sound systems, Jamaican music is made to be played outdoors (with the exception of Dancehall). This is particularly noticeable in the dedication (mainly amplification) on the drum and bass parts. Unsurprisingly, Jamaican music has always been extremely popular at festivals abroad, which helped Jamaican music popularity move forward.<br><br>The Jamaican culture of record producing and spontaneous sound systems has been around as long as the music itself, i.e. even as early as Mento.  This means that Jamaica also introduced the concept of the DJ long before Eurodisco and EDM. The “Disk Jockey” or record player is known as the “Selecta” or selector. The DJ works together with the “MC” or “Master of Ceremony”, who does the “toasting”: Jamaican slang for adding live vocals. The MC also provides “peps”, which are speedy vocals in a Jamaican dialect (that may sound like gibberish) to pep up the crowd, later annexed by Drum ‘n’ Bass. In the beginning the Selector and the MC was one and the same person, but as these two occupations became separated from each other, their respective responsibility increased. Sound systems expanded as well, evolving in more than just a big piece of equipment. They became a treasured relic for a posse of involved artists and technicians. Such sound system posses regularly held battles against each other, to see who had the best records, mixing skills, or toasting talents. More often than not, these battles escalated in a hail of violence: imagine two neighborhood street parties of feuding families shooting at each other.<br><br>Another characteristic of all Jamaican music is a strong emphasis on the offbeat. This gives the music a laidback sound, ideal for warm outdoor weather and smoking marihuana. Indeed, cannabis – cultivated on Jamaica itself – is also partly responsible for the way most Jamaican music sounds, although its influence on the genre must not be exaggerated.<br><br>Besides all technical elements that define Jamaican music, there are other elements which have become a custom overseas, leading to Jamaican or Reggae subcultures in various other countries. Rastafarian colored artwork (red-yellow-green), similar fashion, or dreadlocks as a haircut for example. Dreadlocks were originally a Rastafarian symbol of spirituality, rebellion, individualism and proudness of race (as dreadlocks are something other races cannot so easily obtain). Jamaican music after all is more about non-conformity and originality than anything else. Jamaicans only play what they like. If it is not how they want it, they alter it. If it stops being made, they make it themselves. If it doesn’t exist, they invent it. Unfortunately, the island has ceased to produce any truly original genres since Ragga. Yet one would do well to keep a close eye on any music it brings forth.",

        "description": "All Jamaican music didn’t just appear out of thin air of course. A long and diverse culture of (European and African) <b>Folk</b> music already existed on the Island. This slowly led to the first real popular music genre: Mento. Mento was mostly <b>Calypso</b> (a Latin genre from Trinidad & Tobago) with <b>R&B influences</b>. Because Jamaica forms a junction between American, Latin and other music, Mento featured a whole <b>plethora of different instruments</b>, sounding more chaotic than harmonic. The most important thing however, were the unique lyrics; singers didn’t sing but spoke in a rhythmical and improvised way on top of the music, which was called “<b>Toasting</b>”. These “toasts” would much later be a major influence on Rap and Drum ‘n’ Bass. Mento can be regarded as a Folk music genre instead of a popular one, but being the pioneering Jamaican music genre, it makes sense to include it. Mento artists liked to think of themselves as a part of <b>aristocracy</b>, because the country was still a British colony in the fifties. This is shown in nobility titles such as Prince, Lord, Count, Duke, and King, which became a bit of a tradition in Jamaican music. After Mento, “<b>Bluebeat</b>”, a New Orleans based type of Rhythm ‘n’ Blues named after a record company, paves the way for Ska. ",

        "description": "Ska really put the Jamaican music scene on the map. The nearest American city, New Orleans, brought its own version of <b>R&B (Bluebeat)</b> to the island where the sound was drastically changed. Sound effects like <b>echos</b> and advanced electronic instruments like <b>turntables and sound systems</b> (e.g. the famous Channel 1 and Cocksone Campbell systems) made this possible. The R&B rhythm of Bluebeat became accompanied by a<b> marching beat,</b> an influence from Rock 'n' Roll. Although there are (African) vocals, Ska (like a lot of Jamaican music) is more about the sound and feeling: <b>optimistic, serene and peaceful</b>. Blissful Jazzy riffs, <b>horns and staccato guitars</b> are the main tools to achieve this. Ska is also known for its <b>large brass orchestras</b> (10-20 people) dominating the music, whereas bass is rather simplistic with accent on the offbeat.<br><br>When Detroit Soul and Philly Soul started to <b>eclipse New Orleans Soul</b> (Southern Soul) and New Orleans Blues, Ska experienced a sharp rise, as the Jamaican public - fond of the <b>Crescent City’s music</b> - was forced to take matters in their own hands. This happens simultaneously with the <b>independence of Jamaica</b> in 1962, providing a tremendous opportunity to create a <b>unique and national sound</b> for a new country. Ska becomes a huge success, accompanied by its own jagged, hyperactive type of dancing: <b>Skank</b>. With two subsequent and important <b>ska-revivals</b> (abroad), skank also receives an overhaul and gets picked up later by Hardcore Punk & Jump Up. For the sake of clarity, this genre is therefore pinpointed as the <b>first wave of Ska</b> or <b>Jamaican Ska</b>.",

        "description": "Right after the British Mersey Beat Revolution a small youth subculture, the mods, existed, that listened to their own type of mod Rock & Roll. Almost exactly the same happened in Jamaica after the Ska revolution: <b>young gangsters</b> and street kids (known as “<b>rude boys</b>”) changed the happy, uptempo Ska in something they could relate to: much <b>cooler, slower</b> music (influenced by Soul) with an <b>easy but powerful bass</b> and more Rock influences such as <b>electric guitars</b> (though sparse). This rude boy music became known as Rocksteady. And just as Punk, Rap or Mod, the lyrics were more often than not about<b> political issues</b>, although the music sounded nowhere near as rough, but was often performed in R&B-like <b>small harmony groups</b>. The reason for implementing political content and a <b>slower, laidback and more serious tempo </b>was a <b>slowly growing discontent</b> with the very first Jamaican government installed after the independence in 1962. Another reason for the slowing down of Jamaican music lay in the simple fact that many musicians just didn’t like to play Ska’s hyperactive rhythm. Particularly of notice for Rocksteady, is the famous Jamaican <b>Tuff Gong Records</b> label. Right before the rise of Reggae, Rocksteady led to a specific subgenre known as “<b>Poppa-Top</b>”, which had a looser and bubblier rhythm.",

        "description": "The optimism for new and better governance was quickly waning, when Jamaican citizens realized they were not better off with independence than with colonization. During its infancy as a state, Jamaica failed to address the needs of the poor, especially in urban <b>ghettos</b>.

Embedded in the s<b>unny, warm Caribbean climate</b> of Jamaica and influenced by the abundant availability of <b>marihuana</b>, Reggae doesn’t sound as much <b>reactionary</b> as it is. But to this very day it has never ceased to question authority. Reggae exploded in <b>1972</b>, thanks to both the <b>10 year anniversary</b> of the country (and thus a decade of failed politics) and the film release of “<b>The Harder They Come</b>”, which made Reggae popular overseas.<br><br>The <b>bass guitar</b> became Reggae’s leading instrument, which dropped the first beat of a bar, creating the so called “<b>one drop rhythm</b>” which gives Reggae its characteristic offbeat sound.

This Early Reggae eventually got claimed as the subcultural music of the <b>spiritual Rastafari movement</b>. Rastafari is a special Jamaican faith dating back as early as the thirties, which deals about many issues that are also attributed to Reggae: religion, racism, ghetto-life, cannabis use, <b>African roots</b> and more. The term “<b>Roots Reggae</b>” is either reserved for Reggae strongly expressing Rastafari beliefs and issues, or to distinguish the genre from other Jamaican music.",

One of the main characteristics of Dub manipulation is <b>delay</b>, which is used on many different parts of the song and often in an extensive, panoramic manner. This gives Dub its typical “wah-wah” feeling where sounds seem to bounce back from the walls and never die. All these sound effects synergize well with cannabis, which strongly influenced Dub music (and continues to do so).<br><br>Because of its <b>pioneering technology</b> yet <b>dreamy and surreal sound</b>, Dub was an important inspiration for all kinds of music and remains a living stream in the contemporary world of popular music.

        "description": "Ragga (short for “<b>Raggamuffin</b>”) is purely <b>electronic Dancehall</b> in overdrive. With the introduction of <b>music computers</b>, producers could create digital Dancehall rhythms with lots of bass and nifty sound effects, called “<b>riddims</b>”. Riddims had been around since the age of Dub, where they were known as the basic template of any Dub track, which is the stripped down part of the song with <b>enhanced drums and beat</b> (before sound manipulation). With the advent of Ragga, Dub riddims became accelerated and many more (speedy) riddims were created. A whole <b>parallel collection</b> of riddims - <b>each with his own name </b>- was used interchangeably with different Ragga songs (similar to how the same Surf Rock melodies were used for different songs and artists). After the selection of riddim,<b> harsher and jagged sounds</b> are added by the DJ and toasting vocals make up the work of the MC. Ragga is hyperkinetic rhythm, electrifying Jamaican dance music, unable to resist. And this is why it was a tremendous influence on later Rave and Drum ‘n’ Bass culture.<br><br>The very first Ragga riddim was called “<b>Sleng Teng</b>”, which is sometimes used as a synonym for Ragga. When it comes to lyrical content, the Dancehall slackness only got worse. Ragga MC’s, toasting over this <b>booming digital Rapreggae</b>, have <b>no taboos </b>whatsoever when it comes to sexuality, promoting (straight) sex as much as possible and sometimes getting into trouble with homophobic lyrics. The <b>aggressive, often criminal</b>, and homophobic behavior of Ragga diminishes strongly in the 21st century and Ragga starts to blend in with the “peace-and-unity” philosophy of Reggae.",

The result was similar to Latin Rap, but the rhythm was entirely based on Bomba with no R&B samples whatsoever, and the lyrics were even more <b>explicit</b> than Latin Rap.

    "description": "Hip Hop is not a genre, but a huge subculture encompassing a whole lot more than just music. Hip Hop consists of what is known as “the Four Elements”: breakdancing, graffiti, turntablism (mixing and scratching, the work of the DJ), and rapping (the work of the MC); a harmony of dance, visual art, spoken word, and technology. But Hip Hop also has its own customs, an idiosyncratic “code”, enriching and defining the subculture: gang visual language for a start, or an obsession with clean sneakers to show respect for personal property when rappers could barely afford a second pair of shoes. And let’s not forget “Bling Bling”: often misinterpreted for status symbols, these heavy, exuberant golden necklaces and rings represent ancient African warrior tribe symbols. Because Hip Hop is first and foremost a powerful stance.<br><br>All Rap or Hip Hop music consists of two equally important parts: the beat and the rhyme. The beat used to be made by certain old Funk (or Disco) records which featured breakdowns: sections with only the drummer (and bass) playing. These sections were used to create a continuous (looped) breakbeat (see more at Breakbeat). Sampling, a technique of cutting and pasting small sounds from existing records, was used to complement the breakbeat with melody, bass and sound effects. Though controversial from a legal point of view, the work some artists devoted to create the perfect beat is extraordinary and most samples were never recognized. Since the late eighties, electronic samplers could store and record a variety of samples, leading to a torrent of Rap productions.<br><br>The word “rap” is hip hop slang and translates more or less to “flow” (of words). Rap is thus music consisting of “raps” or flows (or rhymes). The phrase “hip hop” however has very obscure roots, going a long way back into black culture. Hip simply means hip but was often placed near hop, what more or less refers to dancing or partying. Yet the exact etymology has been lost over the course of time. Afrika Bambataa and the Sugar Hill Gang popularized this phrase already known among blacks to describe a gathering, a movement, or a place of both fun and coolness.<br><br>The real power of Rap lies in the opportunity to convey elaborate and profound messages, thanks to the continuous use of lyrics throughout the music. With more words per song than any other genre, Rap can amuse, protest, or connect in ways other genres cannot. Especially the latter is often forgotten: early Rap tried to end ghetto poverty, bigotry and racism by reaching out to white audiences, connecting remote subcultures.<br><br>Rap did not only inherit the concept of sound systems, DJ’s with turntables, and toasting from Jamaica, but also the love for cannabis. Besides Jamaican music, no super-genre is as connected with the drug as Rap, though many rappers have expressed strong anti-drug messages. The aural psychedelic effect of marihuana synergizes well with the repetition of a looped breakbeat combined with unexpected and atmospheric samples, while the psychological effect on reasoning, associating, and verbalizing facilitates high-tempo rapping. One must of course also not forget the incredibly abundant vocabulary of Hip Hop slang, partly as a consequence of marihuana use.<br><br>Rap originates from the ghetto and is strongly regional. Since Rap is more language oriented than other genres as well, its various subgenres are therefore geographically demarcated. However, these subgenres are only withheld in musicmap if they have distinctive technical and ideological properties, not only language. This is why e.g. French Rap, Russian Rap, and Nederhop are not separately mentioned as genres, though they are vibrant and interesting realms of Hip Hop. Since the nillies, Rap has gone through an identity crisis.  The once powerful and innovative concept of rhyming over sampled beats has become commonplace and its magnetism has withered. With more eclecticism, Autotune, file sharing, audio streaming and the coming of “Ring Tone Rap” (inexpensive Rap made for smartphones), Rap has seemed to have traded its warrior mentality for something tangible. Though there are still Rap/Hip-Hop artists that stay true to Hip-Hop’s roots and heritage.",

        "description": "The early stages of Rap (or Hip-hop culture) were very small and brittle. There were only a select number of revolutionary pioneering artists, originating from <b>South Bronx, N.Y.</b> It was quite an experimental scene, with large influences from both Funk and Disco: the main genres in the New York club “Disco Fever”, where Old Skool Rap made its first clubbing entrance. Rap did not originate from nightclubs however, but at <b>spontaneous outdoors neighborhood parties</b>. Jamaican <b>DJ Kool Herc</b> introduced the concept of sound systems which gained huge appeal yet never left the ghetto. Friendly <b>breakdance battles</b>, fought between different dance crews and/or pioneering Rap groups, contributed to a vibe of <b>joy and exuberance</b> at these sound system parties – a scene of something grand stirring on the horizon.<br><br>Old Skool Rap differs from later genres in a modest experimentation with rhymes. Pioneering rappers take <b>existing Disco or Funk records</b>, use instrumental parts, and nicely rap on top of the beat, without deviating from metre or tempo. <br><br>The criticism that Rap lacks originality due to its excessive use of <b>sampling</b> can hardly be justified when one looks at the absurd fusion of completely unrelated techniques and genres in Old Skool Rap: <b>mixing and scratching</b> (a completely new technique) of the most rare Funk records one can find, toasting (a Jamaican vocal technique) over it, while eventually (during Electro Rap) even being influenced by the most innovative electronic music of all time coming all the way from Germany (Krautrock).

        "description": "It took a decade before Rap got out of the ghetto and onto records, conquering the globe. What started in New York, spreaded throughout the<b> whole US East coast</b>, with different <b>Rap groups</b> (usually more than one MC) selling gold or platinum albums. This period (mid till late eighties) were the heydays of Hip-hop, when there was massive appeal combined with still little negative publicity (Rap wasn’t affiliated with either criminality or commercial selling-out yet).<br><br>There are several reasons for this large appeal. Rap gets more appreciated by <b>middle class and white audiences</b>, because they can relate to the music. Rappers start rapping about <b>responsibility, political messages, anti-drugs, anti-capitalism</b> and Hip-Hop is no longer a secluded subculture with “weird’ customs. Especially Run DMC’s implementation of Rock elements and the fact that MTV – who finally became a strong supporter of the music with the program “<b>Yo! MTV Raps</b>” – became national and available on cable in 1983, helped spread East Coast Rap among less obvious audiences. But perhaps the most important aspect of this genre is a different approach in making the music; MC’s no longer rap over existing records, but the <b>beat and the rhyme become one</b>. The beat gets made from scratch, sometimes specifically for a made rhyme, and MC’s evolve in their rhyming skills, resulting in more <b>professional and eloquent flow</b>s than Old Skool Rap.<br><br>The government didn’t always approve with this new music unfortunately, because a number of Rap groups expressed <b>political criticism</b>, tales of ghetto life, explicit language or a <b>favoritism for criminality</b>. These early examples of Gangsta Rap (also East Coast based) are known as the subgenre <b>Hardcore Rap</b>. The Congressional Hearings of 1985 were an immediate consequence of Hardcore Rap and forced all artists with “<b>explicit content</b>” to put a <b>parental advisory label</b> on their albums. But Rap became the principal victim while many explicit Rock or Metal albums were let off the hook, exposing the racist subtext of these labels. However, this “enemy of the state” reputation didn’t stop Rap from becoming one of the biggest phenomenons in eighties’s music.",

        "description": "Musically speaking, Miami used to be one of the most important cities in the eighties. After the arrival of <b>sequencers</b> and the <b>TR-808 drum machine</b>, local producer Amos Larkins used these tools intensively to create a <b>new type of Electro Rap</b>. The bass of Rap beats was enhanced as hard as possible, creating a really <b>fat, greasy bass</b>: ideal for shaking big bootys to, loved by all (black) Miami Bass artists (or at least making video clips of it). In a very straightforward way Miami Bass was redubbed “<b>Booty Bass</b>”. However, the genre probably wouldn’t have grown into a fully mature genre if it wasn’t for Miami’s “<b>stereo wars</b>”, where people showed off and called out each other to see who had the best, most bass-heavy stereo soundsystem. Images of palm trees, <b>eighties stereo cassette boomboxes</b>, and slick pink or leopard-print convertibles immediately spring to mind when listening to this music, which is firmly rooted within that idiosyncratic subcultural context. Miami Bass is pure <b>summer music</b>, with lots of fresh <b>Electro effects</b> and no political or serious lyrics whatsoever. It only dealt about sex and booming sounds in the most explicit way possible, like an Americanized form of Ragga.<br><br>A few years later, <b>New Orleans</b> took cues from Miami and developed its own kind of bass, called <b>Bounce</b>. As a subgenre with little restraint, Bounce is hypersexual music aimed at <b>twerking</b> onto simple Electro beats and breaks, often with <b>vocoded vocals</b>.

        "description": "One side of Rap’s bipolar disorder (playful and fun versus <b>reactionary and profane</b>) grew more and more fierce: the latter. The essence of “Hardcore Rap” – as it briefly existed – was fueled by the frustrations and anger of everyday ghetto life, where the problems of discrimination and poverty forced many into criminality. <b>Ghetto criminals</b> or “gangstas” used Rap to <b>ventilate</b> about this situation in an <b>explicit and aggressive</b> manner. Gangsta Rap evolved at the West Coast of the US, mainly in the (neighbor)<b>hoods of Los Angeles</b>. The situation spiraled out of control, with neverending “<b>turf wars</b>” about which gang was allowed to control which neighbourhood. Not the least of causes for this urban warfare was <b>crack cocaine</b> (smoked crystals), which emerged in the mid eighties and proved to be highly more addictive and destructive than regular cocaine. Eventually the spiral hit rock bottom, culminating in the historical <b>L.A. riots of 1992</b>, not by chance the breakthrough of Gangsta Rap.<br><br>Although in content it’s a lot more hardcore than other Rap, West Coast Rap’s sound is light and <b>funky</b> (fitting for the warm climate). The genre is a paradox of <b>menacing or scandalous messages</b> conveyed through <b>lightweight sounds</b>. The music is filled with stereotypical sound effects: chimes or ringing bells, high-pitched nasal synth tunes, and deep, greasy moog basslines. Especially the offshoot subgenre, <b>G-Funk</b> (G for gangsta), which sampled only the greasiest and grooviest Funk. The focus on royalty-free Rare Groove records and digitally made sounds was an immediate consequence of the <b>ban on sampling</b> after the 1991 Biz Markie court case.  Although West Coast Rap was already slumbering in the late eighties with pioneers Ice-T and N.W.A., the genre erupted into mainstream in ’91-’92 with the notorious <b>Death Row Records</b> label and debuts of some of Rap’s most famous artists.",

        "description": "Out of Jazz Rap, a strong and endless Hip-Hop movement emerged: the new (or “nu”) school. Next to the aggressiveness of Gangsta Rap and vulgarity of South Rap/Miami Bass, the Nu Skool offered a <b>third alternative</b> for Rap fans who wanted more than these transparent provocateurs. As a <b>parallel underground stream</b>, the Nu Skool experimented more with <b>techniques</b> and <b>creating own sounds</b>, earning the name <b>Progressive Rap</b>. Instead of nicely matching the rhyme to a predetermined pattern, Nu-Skool rappers became lyrical swordsmiths, striking their verbal avalanches at any unguarded point of the beat. <br><br>Nu Skool Rap is sometimes divided into <b>three subgenres</b>, based on their lyrical content: Conscious Rap, Abstract Rap, and Political Rap.<br>Even more than the Native Tongues, <b>Conscious Rap</b> stresses the native roots of Africa, often identifying with <b>radical African tribes</b> or <b>militant black Muslims</b>. But – and herein lies the difference – they did so in a <b>revolting</b> manner. No more would the black man rap with a jazzy smile on his face but claim the power back with a fist in the air.<br><b>Abstract or Experimental Rap</b> focuses on <b>special techniques and unexpected rhythms</b>. Content is less  important than form (and therefore abstract) and many microgenres emerge such as <b>Left-Field Hip-Hop</b>.<br><b>Political Rap</b> is self-explanatory: with its sharp and relentless <b>critique on government and corporate society</b> – often with anti-capitalist and <b>anti-illuminati</b> messages – it’s no surprise that Political Rap is rather unknown due to a partisanship of US media in favor of other Rap.<br><br>Ironically, Nu Skool becomes a <b>heavily studied</b> Rap genre among a number of white researchers, as it is a prime example of just how rich and surprising Hip-hop culture can be.",

        "description": "South Rap is a contested genre name, as it serves more as an <b>umbrella term </b>than an easily recognizable style. During the mid nineties, <b>many regional Rap genres</b> emerged in the southern part of the US: <b>Atlanta Rap, Houston/Memphis Rap, New Orleans Rap, Miami/Florida Rap</b>...  Typical about these genres is generally a <b>slower tempo</b> than usual, combined with increased <b>emphasis on bass</b>. The music is supposed to feel ‘<b>thick</b>’ and ‘<b>hot</b>’, displaying the same atmosphere as its environment. Catchy choruses and <b>sexual-themed</b> lyrics (hence the name “Dirty South”) are a staple among the more happy styles of South Rap, in which funny or everyday stories can also appear. On the other hand, <b>raw, gritty rhymes</b> focused on <b>drug trade</b> form the blueprint of other styles (e.g. Memphis Rap). What they all have in common however, is a strong tendency towards <b>partying and clubbing</b>, either happy and nonsensical or dark and heavy. Especially during the nillies, when the more <b>uptempo, twerk-friendly, dance-oriented genre Crunk</b>, with its overlapping subgenre Snap, arrives. Crunk gets its name from <b>shouts</b> to the crowd, known as “crunks”. The combination of <b>synthbass-heavy</b> Crunk with slow-motion, criminal Memphis Rap is only a small step away from Trap. Thanks to a rather eclectic nature and a certain basic shielding from commercial mainstream, South Rap has survived as one of the fittest Rap genres, leading Rap into the new millennium.",

        "description": "Gangsta Rap was not only anti-state (which was nothing new) but also anti-rappers. That is to say: other posses or fake rappers. The proudness of succeeding in genuine criminal entrepreneurship (“Original Gangsta”) while dealing with emotional struggle and “<b>dissing</b>” (badmouthing) other rappers, was the stereotypical image of the gangsta rapper. This attitude gained a huge appeal, also across the country. At the East Coast rappers took more <b>samples from Disco and Soul (piano and strings)</b> rather than Funk (bass guitars, synth), but even Rock was possible. The east coast sound was also produced in a more <b>polished</b> manner. East Coast Gangsta rappers tried to attain less of a ghetto thug image and a lot more of a well-dressed, rich, <b>mobster image</b>. This is where the original meaning of “<b>bling-bling</b>” got lost and caught up in the mix of richness and <b>status symbols</b> such as sport cars, swimming pools and mansions. One must take note that this is actually the <b>second wave</b> of East Coast Gangsta Rap. The first one – Hardcore Rap – emerged during Rap’s Golden Age and never attained the <b>gargantuan record sales</b> the successive wave had. Eventually East Coast Gangsta Rap evolves more and more into a <b>mainstream radio format</b> and loses all hardcore edges to the point where separation from Urban Breaks becomes impossible.",

Trap also drops the beat on an <b>offbeat</b>, giving a more <b>dramatic, slow-motion build-and-drop feel</b>, reminding of Dubstep.

The music genre became <b>immensely popular</b>, but not just for its catchy sound.

It is often considered the most <b>commercial</b> genre of all time, and therefore also one of the most <b>despised</b>, especially by true Rap and R&B artists who feel their genres have been violated.

    "name": "BREAKBEAT",
    "supergenre": true,
    "description": "Although Breakbeat is a genre defined by its technical rhythm component (see more below), there is an underlying racial aspect at stake. Just like Rock ‘n’ Roll is a white translation of black Rhythm ‘n’ Blues, so is Breakbeat the “Caucasian” version of black Rap music. Though this division is not as strong as the R&R / R&B polarity (many black artists are involved in making Breakbeat), it is remarkable how the overwhelming majority of Rap artists are black, while the overwhelming majority of Breakbeat artists are white (considering the fact that these two super-genres are so closely related to each other). This has spurred the necessity of a true “black Dance music genre”, leading to Jungle. Breakbeat is arguably the most difficult super-genre to outline, being propelled by eager experimental artists with highly eclectic music taste.<br><br>Most Breakbeat is regarded as a part of Hip Hop culture, as (Just like Rap) it is also based on the sampling of Funk records to make breakbeats and mostly thrives in the same subculture with corresponding techniques (such as turntablism) or elements (such as graffiti or breakdancing).<br><br>The word “breakbeat” is derived from the section of early Funk or Disco records where all instruments stop playing (breaking) and only the drummer and percussion remains, called the “breakdown”. Such a breakdown section could be used by both Rap and Breakbeat artists to create their own drum samples without the use of a real drummer and before the advent of affordable drum computers. Some samples became more frequently used as breakbeat building blocks than others and received their own name and legendary status. The “Amen Break” for example, is a well-known sample from the Winston’s Funk single “Amen” from 1969. James Brown’s most outspoken breakdown in “Funky Drummer” became the basis for the “Funky Drummer Break”. Honey Drippers with “Impeach the President”, “Synthetic Substitution” by Melvin Bliss and “Apache” by the Incredible Bongo Band are all rather unknown Funk records, yet technically the most played records of all time due to a countless amount of resampling.<br><br>Rap and Breakbeat artists particularly like Funk and Disco breakdowns instead of Rock or Blues ones as these funky drummers introduced “the third beat”: placing kick drums on different beats than in a straight 4/4 rhythm. Both kick drums and snare drums fall on different beats in different bars, with hi-hat on offbeat, creating an asymmetrical pattern. Breakbeat differs from instrumental Rap in a slightly higher speed (110-120bpm) and a heavier use of samples, sound effects and sound manipulation, all placed in different layers at the right point to compose an intricate rhythmical web. This means that Breakbeat tracks are usually too rich and layered to allow rapping on top of them. Take note: harder, more Dance oriented versions of Breakbeat varying between 120-140 bpm exist as well and are easily distinguishable from Rap.<br><br>The middle ground between Breakbeat and Drum ‘n’ Bass has led to a whole group of music genres that can be considered a super-genre on its own: UK Garage (with the inclusion of UK Bass). UK Garage started as an experiment to renew Drum ‘n’ Bass with influences from other EDM such as Breakbeat and Garage House, but soon evolved into a broad and separate subculture with Dubstep as its most well-known exponent. UK Garage experiments with different, unexpected rhythms (like 2-step), creating highly syncopated breakbeat music with a variety of influences to provide treble and a strong Drum ‘n’ Bass influence to provide ultra-deep bass. The latest forms of UK Bass thrive in a strong underground internet culture. With artist names impossible to pronounce and sometimes even requiring special ALT or ASCII keys to type, the underground network of pirate radio’s which made Drum ‘n’ Bass great in the mid-nineties, seems to have been resurrected in a new form.",

American rappers embraced the German revolutionary music and quickly started making Rap music with the aid of <b>drum machines</b> and <b>sequencers</b>, resulting in <b>digital sampling and looping</b> of breakbeats (instead of mixing and scratching, although these two techniques were still heavily used for extra sound effects). Electro has few vocals let alone raps, though if they are present they are usually vocoded.

In 1977, the infamous radio DJ “<b>The Electrifying Mojo</b>” starts playing a mix of <b>Funk and Synthpop</b> in Detroit: Proto-Electro that brings the black Rap community in touch with white electronic music.<br><br>On the other hand, the experiment of Old Skool Rap found itself in a <b>precarious and fragile state</b> at the beginning of the eighties. The music never really caught on and was in danger of being suppressed by Synthpop, which was growing exponentially in popularity. In New York, Afrika Bambataa, principal Electro artist and founder, tried to <b>please both</b> the (white) hipster <b>New Wave scene as</b> the (black) <b>Hip-hop scene</b> from the Bronx.<br><br>With lots of <b>spacy, robotic sounds</b> and <b>basic synthesizer melodies</b> this was definitely a completely different sound than your average Rap song or any early eighties genre for that matter.

        "description": "Breakbeat kicked off as a style on its own with Florida Breaks. No Rap lyrics, no breakdancing, almost no Hip-Hop whatsoever; simply <b>one long break digitally looped</b> over and over. As one could expect at its place of birth, the music is <b>sunny</b> and <b>uptempo</b>, meant to <b>mix</b> together as one endless party breakbeat <b>aimed at clubs</b>. Florida Breaks is based on Electro, yet with stronger basslines. Just as the hard four-to-the-floor beat of Chicago House and Detroit Techno created a <b>nightlife shockwave</b>, so did the unheard of electronic breakbeat of Florida Breaks. With a strong subculture of <b>excessive partying</b> and drug abuse, Florida Breaks or Electro Breaks can be described as “the Rave of Hip-Hop”. Although the first records can be traced back to 1987-’88, the Florida Breaks scene breaks loose around 1993-’94. <br><br>Eventually other artists picked up this mostly <b>DJ-music</b>, got rid of the “Electro”-effects, and focused on the breaks while adding lyrics. Thus Breakbeat gradually evolved from spontaneous mixing (Old Skool Rap) to DJ-sets and finally professional productions with albums and performances (<b>Funky Breaks</b>, and later Big Beat). Funky Breaks, sometimes also used as a synonym for Florida breaks, uses more retro Funk and less Electro elements and forms the bridge between Florida Breaks and Big Beat.",

        "description": "Trip Hop started off within <b>Bristol</b>’s <b>multicultural</b> Hip-Hop scene where members of Massive Attack tried to bring Rap music to a larger (read: white and European) audience. Their early experiments with Breakbeat were  known as “<b>Bristol Breaks or Beats</b>”. Because Bristol also had a significant Jamaican population and (like many British cities) a history of Post-Punk, Trip Hop became an interesting and <b>meticulously crafted blend of styles</b>: part Rock, part Rap, part Ambient, part Jamaican (Reggae, but even more importantly: Dub).<br><br>Around the same time in the U.S., DJ Shadow started to experiment with slower forms of Breakbeat while adding <b>out-of-the-box acoustic samples</b>: strings, guitars, piano. Although the American and British forms of Trip Hop evolved from different paths, the end result was the same: downtempo Breakbeat with <b>minimal instrumentation</b> but often <b>dramatic and/or melancholic</b>. <b>Dub-effects</b> and loops are also very common.<br><br>Trip Hop creates a <b>surreal and moody dream world</b> (hence its name: <b>trippy Hip-Hop</b>) but with just the right amount of “punch” to prevent becoming background music. This makes Trip Hop very popular among <b>marihuana</b> users, but it also allowed a large <b>mainstream breakthrough</b>, especially when vocals are added. It could’ve been just a small and insignificant Ambient Breakbeat subgenre, but Trip Hop wouldn’t settle for mediocre popularity. After both Massive Attack’s and DJ Shadow’s breakthrough, more artists jumped on the bandwagon with successful results.",

The problem was that it sounded too heavy and hardcore for the masses (Hardstep, Techstep, Darkcore…) and that it detracted too many women from going to the clubs. <b>British</b> upper class <b>designers and fashionistas </b>created their own hipster version of Drum ‘n’ Bass, particularly aimed at <b>increasing female club presence</b>. By merging Garage House with Old Skool Jungle and adding <b>sampled (Neo-Soul) vocals</b>, a <b>smooth, textured music</b> was being created that had little in common with regular Drum ‘n’ Bass. <b>Fine, hi-pitched breakbeats</b> and <b>delicate snares</b> made this music unlike anything one would expect at a garage, although it was named UK Garage. This was <b>fancy</b> Breakbeat. Fast, but gentle, bass-driven but with a subtle timbre.<br><br>The first form of UK Garage was a rapid type of syncopated Garage House, known as <b>Speed Garage</b>. Speed Garage’s <b>abundant percussion</b> and heavy bass made the influences from Garage House barely noticeable and thus was still not good enough to attract a large female crowd. The genre did however attract immediate attention from major record labels. Speed Garage became influenced by Ragga and Drum ‘n’ Bass (particularly <b>Hardstep</b>) which <b>altered its time signature</b> in two beats per bar instead of four, which is known as “<b>2-Step</b>”. Despite these influences, 2-Step Garage abandoned bass in favor of sharp but soft treble and returned the sound of Garage House with a touch of R&B.<br><br>These two UK Garage genres marked the start of a large music family - also known as UK Garage - that led to Dubstep and UK Bass. But 2-Step is also the beginning of Nu R&B. Not only due to its sound and rhythm, but by spreading a culture of <b>upper-class clubbing</b> that became notorious (and eventually despised) for its <b>cocain use</b> and promiscuous encounters.",

        "description": "Broken Beats (or Beat or Breaks) is one of those “<b>superfusion</b>” genres, combining all possible influences into a jack-of-all-trades.

Breakbeat-influenced types of Jazz like Acid Jazz and <b>Nu-Jazz</b>, are closely related (and also fusions like Broken Beats) but they are not Breakbeat at their core. In Broken Beats, this core is carefully <b>assembled from cut (broken) beats</b>.  This process occurs entirely with the help of the <b>computer</b>, resulting in very <b>complex, syncopated rhythms</b>, often <b>glitchy</b>. In this manner, the “broken” aspect becomes highlighted. <b>Accentuated snares</b> further enhance the <b>stuttering</b> percussion of this genre. Vocals often appear in a <b>soulful</b> way, making it hard to classify Broken Beats into one super-genre. The rest of the music can be completed à la carte. The fact whether the artist has more of a D’n’B, R&B, House, or Jazz background, will decide which direction it will go. Many Broken Beats producers have a Drum ‘n’ Bass background however, and were in search of a new, <b>experimental answer to deal with D’n’B</b> in the 21st century, inspired by 2-Step.

The scene changes into two different directions: <b>Nu Dark Swing</b>, a darker and moodier bassline focused form preluding Dubstep, and <b>Breakstep</b>, a more breakbeat focused form. Breakstep aka Breakbeat Garage leaves all House and fancy influences behind, and almost immediately a <b>new garde of very young artists </b>starts adding rap vocals and more <b>Drum ‘n’ Bass elements</b> on top of this.

This battle was soon won by the youth, as the “old” garde had lost all connection with everyday (street) life.

Listening to the same name, it can be hard to separate these two genres (Trap Rap and the newer EDM Trap, which is also referred to as Trapstep because of the <b>fusion with Dubstep</b>). The difference between these two “traps” is large though. Trapstep uses only <b>electronic</b> (mainly computer-based) sounds, no turntables, and it has <b>no rap lyrics</b> or R&B samples. Trapstep is dancefloor DJ music, not Rap music. Due to the absence of lyrics, Trapstep focuses a lot more on <b>the drop</b>: the energy is strongly tangible in the build-up, which is often prolongued. The drop itself is <b>as climatic as possible</b> and consists of <b>very deep synth basslines</b>. <br><br>It’s striking that once again Hip-Hop culture reinvigorates Dance music with a whole new style. Trap becomes so popular that it merges with other genres that were already focused around the drop. Trap fuses with Electro House and Moombahton into <b>Trap House and Trap-ah-ton</b> respectively. All these syncopated “drop genres” have become one big melting pot after 2013, making the musical future of EDM even harder to predict.",

    "description": "Drum ‘n’ Bass is arguably the deepest of all super-genres. It is a rolling and thundering sound of breakbeats and basslines, like the ominous distant rumble of a jungle stampede. (Modern) Drum ‘n’ Bass is too complex to create without the use of advanced music software, which explains why it’s one of the youngest super-genres. In the early days, there was a difference between Drum ‘n’ Bass and Jungle (see Old Skool Drum ‘n’ Bass). Despite a select number of fans refusing to disregard that difference, the terms have become interchangeable over the course of time. Jungle is the voice of the black British youth; therefore its ties with both black (Rap) and Jamaican (Ragga and Dub) music genres come as no surprise.<br><br>The noun Drum ‘n’ Bass suggests a combination of two styles, one part drum, one part bass. History teaches that this actually is more truth than fiction: early Drum ‘n’ Bass originates by mixing manually two compatible records from different genres, both highly sped-up. One record often provides samples to create a heavily accelerated breakbeat such as the Amen break, dubplates and Breakbeat Hardcore records. The other a subsonic bass line such as Industrial/Brutal Techno or Rave. Most Drum ‘n’ Bass songs use the Amen Break or Funky Drummer Break as template for their 4/4 breakbeat. Snare drums are placed at second and forth beat of a bar. Drum ‘n’ Bass has a very high speed, ranging between 160-190 bpm. Combined with the use of breakbeats, such high speeds make D’n’B instantaneously recognizable.<br><br>Drum ‘n’ Bass uses many special techniques to create a menacing but futuristic sound. Time-stretching (speeding up certain parts of the tracks without changing the pitch), half speed basslines (decreasing speed and pitch to create deepness), rolling bass lines (eliminating silent spaces between bass notes), and the “Drop”: launching the main part of the song, but more layered and heavier, after breakdowns and long ascending build ups. The key difference between Breakbeat and Drum ‘n’ Bass is that Breakbeat tries to sound “natural” and “organic”, imitating a real drummer. Drum ‘n’ Bass on the other hand, abandons all realism and attempts to create the opposite: synthetic, futuristic and technologic.<br><br>Whereas “Drum ‘n’ Bass” is rather self-explanatory, the name “Jungle” requires further explaining; Apparently, Jungle is derived from the jungle-like Tivoli Gardens in Jamaica, of which a referring sample occurs in an early Jungle Track from Rebel MC. However, countless other explanations are circulating among journalists and enthusiasts, obscuring the truth while strengthening the symbolic value of Jungle’s name.<br><br>Jungle has always had two faces, which is part of the early difference between Jungle and Drum ‘n’ Bass. After the great era of Rave, the whole of Dance music polarizes into two opposite universes, not the least noticeable within Drum ‘n’ Bass. On one side, there’s an intelligent / sophisticated / ambient / progressive approach of the music (Old Skool D’n’B, Jazzstep, Liquid, Dubstep, UKG, Broken Beats), where  on the other hand there’s a hardcore / rave / extravert / linear approach (Old Skool (Ragga) Jungle, Breakbeat Hardcore, Darkcore, Hardstep, Techstep, Jump Up, Post-Dubstep). But these poles obviously influence each other and sometimes cross over. It is this golden combination of complex rhythms combined with deep, threatening basses that makes Drum ‘n’ Bass so popular. Jungle’s sound matches its interwoven sense of militant protest (similar to Reggae or Rap). It combines the attractiveness of “dangerous” Rave with the sophistication of experimental “intelligent” Dance genres: Jungle is a voodoo priest in the shadows - a sinister mastermind.<br><br>In current times, it has become very difficult or even pointless to separate Hardstep, Techstep, Darkstep and Neurofunk. These genres are deliberately separately mentioned on the Carta to show the size and evolution of Drum ‘n’ Bass, but nowadays they have more or less become one, referred to as Darkside. Darkside is – besides Dubstep - one of the three contemporary Drum ‘n’ Bass schools, alongside Liquid and (Nu) Jump Up.",

Drum ‘n’ Bass was part of <b>west side London</b> culture, which was more upper class and “sophisticated”, whereas Jungle was played in the clubs of <b>east side London</b>. Here was the home of the <b>black British youth</b>, usually lower class and streetwise: picture short skirts, training suits, bling bling, sunglasses.

With <b>menacing samples, criminal themes</b>, and a deliberate use of cocaine and marihuana instead of XTC, the war against (white) Rave was on.<br><br>Drum ‘n’ Bass refrained from these convictions and focused on the music itself. Jungle versus Drum ‘n’ Bass polarity quickly faded and in the broad sense (the super-genre) these genres have become synonyms. <b>Metalheadz</b>, the principal and one of the first Drum ‘n’ Bass labels, never differentiated between genres either. Raggamuffin’ style Jungle led to the introduction of <b>toasting MC’s</b> who would accompany the music live with improvised shouts and scattering catchphrases, like a sports coach gone mad, and eventually making even the white man dance.",

        "description": "The trinity of pioneering Jungle genres (Jungle, Drum ‘n’ Bass, and Darkcore) almost emerged simultaneously and it’s still very hard to say which influenced which. While D’n’B and Jungle sounded quite similar, Darkcore clearly was something different. It was literally the <b>dark side of Rave</b>: ecstasy addicts (as were many Ravers) being confronted with the side-effects of intensive drug abuse. Darkcore was the <b>after-XTC-soundtrack</b>: a nightmare of <b>paranoia, hallucinations, and depression</b>, being intensified by government suppression of Rave parties. Besides the <b>aural equivalent of withdrawal</b>, Darkcore was also a reaction to the increasing ridiculousness of Breakbeat Hardcore: too happy, too cartoonish, too childish. <b>Disturbing sounds</b>, awkward <b>time-stretching</b> techniques, and <b>horror film samples</b> combined with an <b>ultrafast</b> tempo of 180bpm, provided adequate ammunition to combat the “stupid” Rave scene. Take note: this scene struck successfully back afterwards with Happy Hardcore and Handbag House. <br><br>After Darkcore and Techstep, Darkstep takes place on the Jungle stage (around 1997-’98). Darkstep can be described as a <b>fusion of Darkcore and Techstep</b>; it also features horror samples, and distorted basslines and has quite complex and dissonant rhythms. Darkstep is recognizable by undoubtedly being the <b>darkest and hardest of all</b> Drum ‘n’ Bass subgenres, which is quite a feat. Darkstep is a machine out of hell on a zealous rampage.<br><br>Darkstep and Techstep evolve in the 21st century into <b>Dark Drum ‘n’ Bass aka Darkside</b>: a more modern and eclectic approach that can also serve as an umbrella term for Hardstep, Techstep, Darkcore, Darkstep and Neurofunk.",

        "description": "By the mid nineties, Rave (in the UK) was completely dead. A new subculture had learned from its mistakes. No more huge pop-up parties, but a<b> pirate radio network</b> broadcasting <b>revolting</b> Drum ‘n’ Bass instead. This <b>hardcore</b> Drum ‘n’ Bass (Hardstep) was simple, <b>purist</b> music but with a very heavy <b>subbassline</b>, fast, <b>2-step drum patterns</b>, and lots of influences from and references to Rap, Ragga, and Dub. It had more or less the same mentality as Conscious Rap: an underground army with <b>back to the roots (black culture)</b> music. Hardstep’s history however, was rather small and shortlived. It had speed and percussion, but lacked melody and atmosphere.<br><br>Around 1996-’97, Hardstep gets pushed aside by the successor of Darkcore: Techstep. This <b>technical</b> Drum ‘n’ Bass, influenced by Brutal and Industrial Techno barely had anything in common with the funky, sophisticated Detroit sound. Filled with heavily manipulated <b>reese-basslines</b> and so called “<b>butcher beats</b>”, this should’ve been called <b>Industrial Drum ‘n’ Bass</b>: loud, uncompromising, grotesque, nihilistic factory noise. Techstep almost immediately saw the potential of heavy D’n’B thanks to Hardstep, and took it up another notch. Full of <b>sound effect experimentation</b>, it was an <b>antimusical sadomasochistic soundtrack</b>, just like early Industrial but painted for a <b>gritty</b> post-Rave selfish world, instead of a conceptual movement. <br><br>Though Techstep is stylistically more linked to its predecessor Darkcore and its successor Darkstep, its joining with Hardstep illustrates D’n’B’s rapid transformation in the mid nineties and what that expresses: a <b>requiem for a lost Rave dream</b>, ruptured into an aural nightmare, like Heavy Metal after the flower power age. The rise in popularity of<b> militant, underground</b> Drum’n’Bass coincided with (and became propelled by) the <b>Criminal Justice Act </b>of 1994 in the UK, which prohibited parties with “repetitive beats” (which Drum ‘n’ Bass did not have).",

These genres were significantly more <b>complex and sophisticated</b> than before: Hardstep, Techstep, Darkstep, and Jazzstep.

The behavior of stationary nodding to the beat (or even <b>sitting down</b>) while smoking marihuana became commonplace and alarmed a number of producers. They wanted the crowd to party, which lead to a genre specifically aimed at doing so: Jump-Up. Definitely more <b>heavy and bass-focused</b> than early Drum ‘n’ Bass but still <b>less dark</b> than Hardstep and Techstep, Jump Up seeks to combine the most popular elements of Jungle, for which it sometimes also gets despised: <b>simple, catchy melodies, Ragga basslines, and speedy drum loops</b>.<br><br>Because the music was particularly aimed at <b>dancing</b>, it eventually brought along a new dance style, borrowed from Punk subculture: <b>skank</b>.

With crossovers into other “sophisticated, intellectual” music such as <b>IDM and Jazz</b>, this “intelligent” Drum ‘n Bass took itself very seriously (some say too). Major record labels took an interest and started releasing records for the elite audio connaisseurs (with complex, <b>deep, atmospheric</b> melodies) and labeling itself “<b>Artcore</b>”, but many synonyms exist: Ambient, Atmospheric or Intelligent Drum ‘n’ Bass and Jazzy Drum ‘n’ Bass or Jazzstep as the more Jazz oriented type (though these two share so much overlapping that we regard them as sibling genres).

As the name suggests, Neurofunk borrowed some influence from<b> Funk (and Jazz)</b> to make this happen, but in a barely noticeable manner.

        "description": "Dubstep can be described as the only true innovative Dance genre since 2000 (alongside Grime), and is sometimes even labeled as a super-genre on its own. After all, it’s hard to categorize; falling somewhere in between Breakbeat, Drum ‘n’ Bass, Downtempo and Jamaican music (Dub). Drum ‘n’ Bass is chosen here, as Dubstep is most closely related to its subculture and most similar in instrumentation and sound manipulation, but there are large differences. <br><br>Just like Dub, Dubstep started out as <b>instrumental B-sides</b>, only <b>Grime</b> ones instead of Reggae. Popularity rose beyond expectations however, when UK Garage’s involvement around bling bling, champagne, and mainstream success became too much to bear for the average UKG fan. Underground radio <b>Rinse FM</b> and specialized Dubstep club nights in the UK tapped into that discontent and were responsible for shaping the genre into an institution. <br><br>Early or True Dubstep is recognizable by an <b>eerie, ambient soundscape</b>, heavily influenced by Dub, which it lost over the years in subsequent subgenres. To fully appreciate Dubstep, a decent subwoofer or (club) sound system is vital, as frequencies tend to drop even below Drum ‘n’ Bass. These <b>LFO-subsonic basslines</b> are often <b>re-oscillated</b>, creating the stereotypical Dubstep “<b>wobbly bass</b>”, which got transferred to other music genres afterwards. Dubstep has a steady <b>repetitive drum rhythm</b> (kick-snare-kick-snare) <b>stretched</b> far <b>apart</b>, and thus leaving lots of <b>listening room</b>, while also making Dubstep appear slower than its actual tempo (<b>140bpm</b>). Overall sound production can either be hyperclean (like Neurofunk) or gritty/industrial (like Techstep). Dubstep is about surprising and touching the inner mind with sound experiments, no matter the manipulation, just like Dub did before. Therefore lots of effort is being put in <b>percussion arrangements</b> and <b>distortion of mid-range sounds</b>. The long and eager anticipation of young electronic composers for their own revolutionary genre– the <b>sound of the nillies generation</b> - naturally led to an abundance of crossovers, subgenres and a more commercial approach: enter Post-Dubstep.

        "description": "In early Dubstep, beat drops were accentuated by the stretched drum pattern. Over the course of time, these <b>drops</b> became more and more important, with long <b>build-ups</b> running up to them. Artists even held races to see who could create “<b>the biggest drop</b>”. Ambient soundscapes also got replaced by <b>hooks</b> providing catchy melodic themes. When finally <b>mid-frequency rifflike synth lines</b> get introduced in the famous subgenre <b>Brostep</b>, Dubstep becomes accepted by the masses in the US and a <b>versatile template</b> on which just about any song can get remixed. This sparked a <b>huge wave of revulsion</b> between the early Dubstep producers/fans and the new (Post-Dubstep) garde, particularly Skrillex. Dubstep breaks loose out of its UK underground environment and <b>spreads like a virus</b> to other contemporary genres also eager to <b>cross over</b>: Electro House / Ghettotech / Trap / Nu R&B / Grime. A whole array of subgenres appears on the stage, but most importantly is the merging with Drum ‘n’ Bass. Hereby, Dubstep <b>reinvigorated the super-genre</b> and united both subcultures in the form of <b>Drumstep</b>. Apart from alternating between Jump-Up’s rolling and Dubstep’s chopped breakbeats, Drumstep is composed in <b>half-time rhythm</b>.<br><br>In 2010, Post-Dubstep as a name arises, which is a collection of many subgenres. Besides Brostep and Drumstep, Post- Dubstep includes the crossovers <b>Funkstep</b> and <b>Electrostep</b>, and the harder subgenres <b>Deep Dubstep</b> (return to Dubstep roots like the implementation of LFO wobbly bass) and <b>Filthstep</b> (Dubstep with “filthy” synth lines).",

        "description": "If you would imagine what the future of UK Garage would sound like, you probably wouldn’t deviate too much from “Future Garage”: <b>genre-defying, hypereclectic</b>, hard-to-define. Future Garage is influenced by many contemporary genres, not the least Chillwave and Post-Dubstep, who are highly diverse themselves. To reconcile the rather <b>dreamy, poplike</b> character of Chillwave with the heavy, uptempo sound of Post-Dubstep, a middle ground was created that is more like the center of the musical universe: anything goes. However, in order not to stray afar from one influence or another, this middle ground is more defined and constrained than expected. Especially after the <b>coalescence with Trapstep</b>, a genre that rhythm- and tempo-wise seamlessly blends in. And thus Future Garage turns around 2014 into Future Bass. Due to considerable overlapping, it is not recommended separating these genres. Future Bass – the newest big music genre so far – combines <b>detuned, enveloped synths</b> with <b>ambient, natural sounds</b> and pronounced <b>offbeats</b>. <b>Synthed out and melancholic but joyful vocals</b> (almost always female) add to a fast rising popularity. Future Bass has a very recognizable mood: the music submerges you into a <b>surreal aquarium</b> with “<b>glittering” sounds</b> (similar to the latest developments in Liquid Funk), where you can hear both the distant drums from the jungle shore and the muted wailings of sirens on the rocks. Already, copious subgenres have emerged, who work on different types of mood, such as <b>Dreambass, Ambient Bass</b>, and <b>Nightbass</b>. ",

    "name": "HARDCORE",
    "supergenre": true,
    "description": "Originally, Hardcore was a subgenre of Techno, but one strongly influenced by (Acid) House (thus being a hybrid). When compared to other EDM super-genres, Hardcore has no clear start but is the result of a gradual evolution. It is characterized by being harder, darker and faster than regular Techno, in which there (literally) is no more room for Funk/Electro basslines. This evolution was spearheaded by the steep rise of XTC (and in lesser extent amphetamines), founded in early Acid House/Madchester club culture. Though Hardcore can take on a greater variety of forms than most people suspect, the common factor has been consistent throughout its history: sheer ecstasy; an intense rush preferably shared with a massive crowd to intensify even more. Where (regular) Techno has a built-in restraint for the formulaic and House tries to please as many as possible, Hardcore is without compromise. It can be silly, cheesy, thundering, ruthless, ridiculous, exaggerated or all of the above, marketing itself to a much narrower niche of listeners. However, in turn these listeners are grateful for providing such traits eschewed by other Dance genres and thereby form a loyal fan base: a smaller but harder core.<br><br>A very distinguishable feature of Hardcore is that it is (usually) a lot faster than other Dance music, starting from 150-160 bpm and sometimes even reaching 1000bpm (which results in a single tone).  If it’s not particularly fast, like New Beat or the First Wave of Rave, it is definitely much harder and more menacing than other Dance music, favouring sound distortions and very deep bass. Hardcore seldom uses melodies, but relies on a composition of synth stabs to create melodic treble. Similar to Punk’s power chords, synth stabs create a “broken” but more powerful and energetic feel. Uniquely, Hardcore can either have a steady, hyper-fast four-to-the-floor beat, which includes the most well-known genres, or a breakbeat in the form of more obscure fusions with Jungle and Breakbeat.<br><br>The psychoactive effect of XTC on music listening has probably been the main contributor of Hardcore Techno’s entire development. In high dosages, the drug pushes the music more to the background while tightening the senses and thereby creating a craving for more intense and ecstatic music. As the average XTC consumption grew larger and larger (especially in the Netherlands), Hardcore’s sound altered too. Until the tempo and heaviness became too much, and slowly Hardcore geared down again. Despite heavy XTC and amphetamine use, there are a significant amount of drug-free fans, some even straight-edge. For these people, music simply cannot be intense enough and Hardcore provides something no other genre can deliver.<br><br>Hardcore Techno can be divided into two large music groups: Rave XL and Gabber XL. The first group, the collection of Rave genres (New Beat, true Hardcore Techno, Darkcore, Breakbeat Hardcore, Freetekno, Acidcore, etc.) is an even more well-known phenomenon than the encompassing super-genre Hardcore. Its excesses reached large media coverage during Rave’s peak years (1990-1992). Rave started Hardcore’s culture of massive parties (known as “Raves” ) filled with wild, exuberant people and all kinds of silly extravaganza. Yellow smileys, candy colors, bubble solution, glow sticks, whistles, sunglasses at night and oversized clothing: anything goes in the world of Rave.<br><br>The second music group, Gabber and related Hard Dance genres (early Gabber, Speedcore, Terrorcore, Nu Style, Hardstyle, Jumpstyle,…), took a more serious but also more extreme approach. It concentrated on the (intensity of the) music and shielding off its culture from outsiders. Moving pop-up raves became replaced by smaller and fixed (club) parties, but eventually mega dance events returned the spirit of ecstatic Rave. Gabber XL (in the broad sense) survived by transmuting into a more accessible style, influenced by Hard Dance. There’s a large but interesting obscure area of crossover styles between Hardcore and other EDM genres. Hardstyle, Jumpstyle and Tekstyle now hold Hardcore’s key to the future. But in these eclectic times, constrained super-genres seem highly unlikely. Which is a good thing considering Rave and Gabber have already penetrated the outer limits of the Dance galaxy and sown the seeds of Hardcore.",

The club was the famous Boccaccio and the country was <b>Belgium</b>: home to the gloomy and avant-garde EBM. The atmosphere and sounds of EBM matched perfectly the lower tempo of this “<b>New Acid House Beat</b>”, forming a <b>gateway between Industrial and Dance</b> and leading eventually to a whole new group of genres: Hardcore. The genre was not dark or depressing though. The sounds were <b>heavy and sluggish</b>, like a crushing giant, but the lyrics were a mix of <b>fun and nonsense</b>. With its rather slow 110bpm, New Beat formed a <b>comfortable prologue</b> for House/Techno, as the European public wasn’t ready yet for American 130bpm House or Techno. Eventually New Beat became <b>too ridiculous</b> (with opportunistic bands cashing in on a template of mystery and sex), which forced the original composers to flee the scene. But the foundations were already laid for a whole new super-genre that was not born to please the majority: Hardcore.",

        "description": "What Punk was to Rock, Rave was to Dance. The all-changing, undeniable <b>shock-revolution</b>, shaking things up that otherwise might have gone stale. In Germany and Belgium, <b>young, militant DJ’s</b> discovered the infamous <b>“hoover” sound</b>: an accelerated, distorted sound of an alien vacuum cleaner being turned on. In the beginning this <b>dark and brutal European underground Techno</b> was purely <b>instrumental</b> and <b>barely melodic</b> (such as the pioneering classic “<b>Energy Flash</b>” by Joey Beltram), but gradually the tempo increased and the hoover sounds were used to establish an anthem like, <b>bombastic melody</b>. This led to a sort of dance music unheard of: <b>dark, hard, ecstatic, overwhelming</b>. Rave became a party phenomenon, especially in the UK and the Netherlands: massive <b>illegal</b> and secret <b>pop-up parties</b> (called “Raves”) with excessive drug abuse were soon the target of a nationwide police hunt. This was even reflected in the music: <b>alarm bells, sirens</b> and other paranoia-inducing effects all added to the <b>theatrical overstimulation </b>that is Rave.<br><br>The most important aspect of Rave is undoubtedly <b>XTC</b>. What was already a small shock during New Beat and Acid House, completely erupted when the perfect XTC soundtrack was finally conceived. Stuff to <b>intensify the XTC-rush</b> such as gadgets, Vicks inhalers, glowsticks, and lasers were born in the era of Rave and were eventually transferred to contemporary dance culture.<br><br>Just like Punks or Goths, a new subcultural stereotype emerged: <b>the “Raver”</b>. With loose, flashy clothing of the early nineties slightly influenced by Rap fashion, Ravers lived in the <b>center of a yolo-universe</b>, where everyday could be their last (which it was for some). Rave was a way of life, reflected by the notorious creed: “<b>Eat Sleep Rave Repeat</b>”. ",

        "description": "Breakbeat Hardcore is an important EDM genre with a fairly complex evolution. Early <b>Hip House rappers</b> started to make accelerated, silly Pop House music that became quite popular within Acid House Rave culture. This music then merges with early Hardcore Techno into true Breakbeat Hardcore, aka <b>Old Skool Hardcore</b>. <br><br>Breakbeat Hardcore has <b>pitched breakbeats, half-speed basslines</b>, and is known by a <b>very amateur, raw, DIY sound</b> with simplistic artwork and an arsenal of <b>illegal samples</b>. Anyone could quite easily make this music, and a <b>huge underground pirate movement</b> took matters into their own hands, churning out the so called <b>‘Ardkore</b> record after record. Just like Free Techno, <b>Free Hardcore</b> was born. Immediately afterwards, Breakbeat Hardcore becomes influenced by Ragga (resulting in Proto Drum ‘n’ Bass known at the time as “<b>Hardcore Jungle Techno</b>”) and by Eurodance (resulting in <b>Pop-Rave</b>), but mainly by Italo Disco (resulting in <b>4-beat</b> and <b>Piano House aka Italo House</b>).

When you are a dock worker in the cold and industrial <b>harbor city of Rotterdam</b>, that principle can only lead to the hardest music imaginable. Thus in the Netherlands the original link of Hardcore with Industrial (in the form of New Beat) was refreshed by deeply <b>distorting</b> a multitude of <b>industrial-heavy kick drums</b>. Early Rotterdam Gabber and the more well-known exponents immortalized by the famous <b>Thunderdome</b> compilation albums, were relatively slow (150 bpm), but soon these kick beats were accelerated to the fastest tempo in the world of music: <b>above 180 bpm</b>. At first Gabber was simply called Kickhouse or <b>Powerhouse</b> (due to its strong beats) but soon got renamed after one the first Gabber clubs: “De Van Gabberhal”. Gabber is a Dutch word meaning “<b>buddy</b>” and the word stuck, as a fitting reference to the <b>conciliating vibe</b> at such parties. This must come as no surprise, with endless availability of empathic <b>XTC</b>. Consumption even increased and was joined by <b>methamphetamine</b> pills.

    "description": "Techno is a bit like an abstract painting: it is an impressionistic interpretation of the Funk groove inspired by futuristic visions, nihilistic views, electronic circuits, or the networks of the inner mind. It is the most introverted of all super-genres - the quiet thinker – who likes to fiddle with technology until the wee hours of the morning. More than anything else, Techno is the father of all electronic Dance. Together with House, it gave offspring to countless genres. Originally, Techno was more sociologically constrained than nowadays. Within Detroit, Techno was meant for the lower class citizens where Garage House was rather meant for upper class. House was fashion/design/hipster, whereas Techno was industrial/sweaty/funky. Although this chasm quickly faded when EDM landed in Europe, the spirit of the hardworking blue collar man still resonates deep within Techno’s soul.<br><br>If House is “Disco’s Revenge”, then Techno is without a doubt “Funk’s Revenge”. Techno bass lines are based on Funk grooves, but completely electronically made. Techno uses sounds that hover in between the natural and the artificial, between analogue and digital; sounds that may be real or may not. Techno’s funky groove becomes dance by introducing repetition and more pronunciation on each 4/4 beat. Bassline and beat work strongly together and are often deeper and harder than House. Each and every Techno track ever created has been a quest for finding the perfect rhythm through a careful combination of basslines and drum kicks. Techno is usually also a tiny bit faster than House, with average BPM ranging between 130 and 140. Strong influences from Electro, Techno’s direct forefather, surface through technological blips and sounds, which accompany the rhythm without becoming melody (like Trance) or ambience (like House). A very important aspect of Techno is that it’s the only Dance super-genre that is (almost) always instrumental. House, Trance, Hardcore and others often feature vocal samples. Techno almost never; it symbolizes the emancipation of electronic rhythm. The rhythm is the star, the front member; there is no need for voice.<br><br>The original “Belleville Three” Techno creators were strongly fascinated by science fiction and technology. Dreams of futuristic cities as in Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner” formed a harsh contrast with the current state of their derelict home town; the city that had lost its motor: Detroit. In one sci-fi novel, “Techno City” by Alvin Snurr, they found a trademark name to distinguish their Funk-based music from the brand new Disco-based Chicago House. Techno House was the name of the new genre. The seamlessly futile yet critical decision at the time to release one of the first full records as simply “Techno” would righteously divide early EDM into two separate schools instead of one, with gargantuan consequences.<br><br>In the nineties, the word Techno becomes often used as an umbrella term for all Dance music. It is of course advisable to refrain from such confusing and incorrect terminology, but it does illustrate the exponentially rising popularity of the genre at the time. Real Techno is rather limited in its amount of subgenres; its purist and minimalist approach allow little room for a large variety of styles. Techno hasn’t produced new styles in quite some time. However, lately Techno has become popular in less expected parts of the globe, where it fuses with regional world music. In Mexico, Techno mixes with Norteña and becomes “Nortec” (or Tecno Rifa) and in Brazil a new genre emerges known as “Tecnobrega”. Although Techno has barely renewed itself since its inception, one must regard this as proof of Techno being perhaps the most timeless of all super-genres. Partly because voice and singer personality give music a temporal frame, a mortal dimension. Early adversaries claimed that the fad Techno would soon become outdated, especially as it was so technology bound. Yet after thirty years it still is the ultimate DJ failsafe, regardless what kind of crowd.",

        "description": "Although officially originated from House, Techno already had a slumbering pre-existence before that. In the <b>depressing, cold “motor city”</b> of Detroit, where high unemployment rates gave little reason to celebrate, a select few composers were working with <b>analog sequencers</b> on another type of Dance music. Something not meant for upper class euphoric celebration, but as a soundtrack for the <b>lower class</b> of this city of <b>abandoned factories and machine-like rhythm</b>. Based on the blueprint of Funk-influenced Electro, Techno evolved – borrowing the pounding beat from Chicago House – into a fast rhythm. The music is (almost) <b>strictly instrumental</b>, where any Funk influence is stripped down to its bare minimum. The <b>emancipation of</b> <b>(electronic) rhythm</b> became a fact; its future influence unforeseen and unimaginable.<br><br>Detroit Techno was first and foremost the brainchild of the three legendary Godfathers of Techno, known as the <b>Belleville Three</b>: Juan Atkins (the “Originator”), Kevin Saunderson (the “Elevator”) and Derrick May (the “Innovator”). The Belleville Three were already experimenting with electronic music in 1982, building further on the <b>Electro legacy</b> of Detroit nurtured by the Electrifying Mojo; this is known as <b>Detroit Electro</b>: Proto-Techno. It wasn’t after the explosion of Chicago House though, that Techno truly took form as the genre we know.<br><br>It is recommended to regard <b>Acid Techno</b> as a part of Detroit Techno.

        "description": "(Free)Tekno is where Classic Techno meets the post-Rave cultural movement. Many (German) producers were eager to try out the faster BPM and <b>hyperactive Rave sound effects</b> of Hardcore (Techno) in a slightly more subtle, rhythmically looping approach. In the afterwake of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany heavily welcomes <b>anarchistic</b> and experimental music. But the genre really bursts open when British Rave producers and <b>sound system crews</b> are forced to flee the country after the initiation of the Criminal Justice Act in 1994. The result of these influences is Rave bended towards Techno: <b>harsh, extremely fast</b> (170-200bpm) and <b>pounding</b>; te<b>K</b>no (aka tekkno) instead of the softer, ambient teCHno. Tekno is also known as <b>Hardtek</b>, but the genre is not as hard as Hardtechno.  In a wild and rapidly spreading scene across the European continent (<b>diaspora</b>), parties and DJ’s popped up out of nowhere, particularly in the Chech Republic and Hungaria. Suddenly anyone and everyone could make dance music, and Techno was no longer an American elite underground thing. In Europe, it became a <b>full-scale, DIY, liberating pop culture</b>: Techno was set free. The corresponding cultural movement is very similar to Rave but on a much smaller scale: sound systems and <b>Tek(no) tribes (communities)</b> join up at <b>free pop-up festivals</b> or parties, usually at illegal places. Despite trouble with authorities, especially at more recent Hardtek festivals, early Freetekno helped spread Dance awareness (albeit in a very <b>reactionary</b> manner) and spearheaded <b>official funding </b>for all EDM festivals and parties in Europe, whereas the US refused to do so at the time.",

This makes sense, as what exactly does make music intelligent? There certainly never was any intention to do so. Early IDM composers just wanted to create Techno music with <b>analog instruments and samples</b>. Just as the polarity one can find in Drum ‘n’ Bass (<b>sophisticated/intellectual</b> versus generic/ entertaining), IDM was the opposite pole of Rave: <b>reserved, eclectic, slow</b>, and determined to stay <b>underground</b>. This was no coincidence: especially Breakbeat Hardcore was responsible for the heavy backlash that is IDM. The songs have a <b>complicated, unexpected</b> structure and are compiled of a variety of <b>analog effects, acid bleeps, washes, breaks and scratches</b>. There’s often m<b>ore than one bassline</b>, as deep as possible. IDM is sometimes hard to separate from Artcore/Jazzstep or more experimental forms of Breakbeat, because the classic <b>four-to-the-floor Techno beat</b> is often <b>abandoned</b>. After the rise of Jungle, IDM starts to use Drum ‘n’ Bass rhythms as well, which makes the genre almost <b>impossible to categorize</b> within a single super-genre. For those who like to restrain from a certain degree of pigeonholing, IDM can be regarded as one with Ambient Techno, as they share a great deal of overlapping.<br><br>Like Rave, IDM was born in a series of illegal parties across the UK, but where they preferred the opposite type of music. Center point was the city of <b>Sheffield</b>, with the leading label <b>Warp Records</b>. At first the music was rather minimal and less experimental and called <b>Bleep Techno</b> or <b>Bleep ‘n’ Bass</b>.

        "description": "Detroit Techno only had very limited popularity in the States. American DJ’s were forced to turn their eye on Europe and found the perfect breeding ground for Techno in Germany. When the <b>Berlin wall falls in 1989</b>, the city becomes an empty vessel, welcoming Techno with open arms. Abandoned Industrial buildings such as the famous Trésor in Berlin became seized by the masses as their church where Techno was the sermon. Germans were thirsty for <b>hard, industrial, uncompromising beats</b>, and under the influence of the Neue Deutsche Welle (German New Wave), Belgian Techno (New Beat meets early Techno) and EBM, Detroit Techno changes into a <b>harder and faster (135 bpm)</b> version of itself but particularly more <b>abrasive</b>. This <b>second wave of Detroit Techno</b> – aka Industrial Techno – is thereby an adaptation for a European audience by American producers, primarily known by its quintessential record labels: <b>Underground Resistance</b> (UR) and <b>Plus 8</b> (+8). Although early UR and +8 records are more a part of Detroit Techno, the later works form a strong contrast with it, due to clearly a harder and rugged sound. Belgian <b>R&S Records</b> embraces American Techno producers as well, where some start to develop a slightly more euphoric sound towards Rave, known as <b>Brutal Techno</b>. <br><br>Around <b>1994</b>, German Techno becomes even harder and faster, with <b>maximum-intensity kick drums</b> and an average <b>bpm of 145</b>. This specific genre was named “<b>Schranz</b>” by Chris Liebing, yet the term has no litteral translation. Schranz focuses less on bass than Industrial Techno, and more on <b>distortion and repetition</b>. Industrial Techno, Brutal Techno and Schranz exhibit a long evolution of Detroit Techno once it sets foot on European soil; a genre that clearly is <b>hard to constrain</b>, but rather a lineage that continuously strengthens and accelerates, culminating in Hardtechno.",

        "description": "In the early nineties Techno was being <b>contaminated by</b> the things it defies most: <b>melody, eclecticism, noise</b>. Especially the anything-goes-mentality of Freetechno and the tempo-overdrive / noise-overdose of Gabber Hardcore became too much for a number of composers. Minimal Techno was their resort and the genre is exactly what you would expect: a simple 4/4 electronic kick beat, enhanced by rhythmical electronic sounds, but with <b>barely anything more</b>. Some authors even claim that Minimal Techno “is defined by what it denies itself”. Minimal Techno focuses more on <b>slow and steady progression</b>, and therefore can have much <b>longer songs</b> than regular Techno. Since all kind of melody is removed, it may be perceived as <b>dark and menacing</b>, a trait that sometimes gets enhanced in its sound manipulation. But because of its <b>purity and simplicity</b>, its appeal and sound is <b>timeless</b>, withstanding any change or revolution in the world of EDM since its birth. And this is exactly why many Techno fans adore Minimal; due to its purism it is furthest removed from House, Trance, and Hardcore: the paragon of Techno.<br><br>Two smaller Techno subgenres are closely related to Minimal Techno: the important <b>Dub Techno</b>, which features influences from Dub and recently regained popularity, and <b>Gloomcore</b>, a very obscure, darker form of Minimal Techno.",

        "description": "Tech Trance aka Techno Trance is indeed the middle ground between Techno and Trance. Although most songs tend to lean towards Techno, the majority of artists have a Trance background. Tech Trance differs from Trance by lacking build-ups or breakdowns, and melody is approached with restraint: no arpeggios, progressive evolution or multi-layering. Its Trance personality lies in the <b>conjunction of distorted synthesized sounds</b> into a <b>repetitive leitmotif</b>, over and over again. This is Tech Trance’s most recognizable trademark. One can hardly describe this motif as melody in a traditional, hypnotic Trance manner. <b>Innovative and intensive use of delay</b> on a recurring series of hard synth notes turns the genre more into a <b>one-trick-pony</b>, but with perfect execution of that trick. Tech Trance is also responsible for introducing <b>side-chaining</b> into the world of EDM: a technology to reduce the volume of certain frequencies, which is often used to create the illusion of a loud bassline.<br><br>Though originated in 1998, it wasn’t until 2006 that Techno Trance rose to the foreground. The strength of Techno Trance lies in a seducing “<b>go-go</b>” mentality: easy to get into, hard to stand still. Compared to e.g. NRG, Tech Trance is more uptempo and features an <b>abundance of percussion</b> assembled into <b>complex, rushing rhythms</b>: the craftsmanship of Techno married to the hypnotism of Trance.",

    "name": "HOUSE",
    "supergenre": true,
    "description": "House, daughter of mother Disco, is the stereotypical feel-good dance floor music with a steady beat. The most important word in the previous sentence is “feel-good”. House sets itself apart from other Dance genres by providing groove and soul. House is digital Rhythm ‘n’ Blues with a feeling of playfulness, warmth and compassion. Without her focus on positive vibes, she becomes another super-genre.<br><br>The revolutionary rise of House (and later Techno, Hardcore, and Trance) was accelerated by synergetic circumstances. Number one: new drum computers and electronic music instruments emerged in the early eighties, which made music making affordable for a single person and even possible without education. Secondly, the discovery of XTC as the perfect party drug, finally accepted by the masses thanks to more powerful beats and an escapist non-stop club (disco) culture.  Thirdly, the shocking spread of AIDS, which decimated the homosexual community in the early eighties and spread a wave of fear.  Because of this, House music became a substitute for sex, as casual sex was deemed too dangerous.  As the matter of fact, the gay crowd preferred to hang around longer in clubs (instead of going home with a partner) and engage in sexual dancing, sweating, teasing, touching and losing itself on XTC (and other drugs) in the music. All this led to longer parties, longer DJ sessions, harder beats, more ecstatic sounds and the search for a musical substitute for pleasure: this is House music. Even though House has taken on many forms throughout history (whether it turns to Pop, Electro or Disco), the universal language of pleasure and joy (completely void of political or personal message) is always present. This universalism and happy escapism explains why House is still the most popular EDM super-genre today, always receiving the main stage or room in favour of other Dance music.<br><br>House is defined by a steady straight 4/4 drum beat, ranging somewhere between 120 and 130 bpm. House has a pronounced kick drum on the quarter beat of the bar, which is defined as a “four to the floor” rhythm. Of all Dance genres, House diverts the least of its average tempo (123-125bpm), which makes it easy to mix different records. A warm, soulful bass groove or R&B influences are other stereotypical House components.<br><br>The name House is derived from the Chicago based club where the genre originated: the Warehouse. This musical phenomenon quickly became common phrase: “Do you have the music they play down the ‘House?” It is however questionable if this name would have stuck so well if it didn’t symbolize a whole lot more: Unity – Love - Acceptance. As Chuck Roberts shouts over Rhythm Control’s “My House”  in a paramount vocal sample of electronic music history: “[…] once you enter my House, it then becomes our House and our House music. And you see: no-one can own House because House music is a universal language, spoken and understood by all.” House became a synonym for tolerance: the urban soundtrack of the black, the gay, the bohemians and the outcasts.<br><br>House can be divided into three large waves, each consisting of multiple subgenres. The first one harbours the pioneering American genres (Chicago, Garage and Acid House), which could be called Classic House. The second wave is a diverse collection of styles that emerge once House sets foot on the European continent, like a diaspora of House (Prog, Deep, Funky, French and Euro-House). The third and final wave has a distinct sound from previous genres: Electro House and derivative genres (Electro House, Complextro, Moombahton, Big Room). Lately, Electro House has run its course and a rising interest in Classic House such as Nu-Disco, is noticeable. As always in the world of popular music, history repeats itself and with strong popularity of outlying genres Trapstep and UK Bass, the question remains what House’s Revenge will be.",

        "description": "The <b>gay discotheques</b> of Chicago (mainly for black males) already had a history of long, <b>decadent, hypersexual parties</b> before 1984. But suddenly the scene changed into something even more intense: the Disco four-to-the-floor <b>beat</b> got <b>more pronounced</b>, most of the lyrics disappeared, and <b>offbeat hi-hats, synth basslines</b> and <b>pianos</b> took their place. King of Chicago House was the <b>TR-909 drum computer</b>, endlessly pounding even harder kick drums than before at the popular rate of <b>122-125bpm</b> (not too fast, not too slow). The combination of a rather slow EDM tempo, a deep and rich R&B bass, diva vocals (usually) and tickling piano melodies culminated in a <b>tingling, all-night-long dance sensation</b>, intensified by <b>XTC</b>. Although Ecstasy already existed during the sixties and the flower power age, it wasn’t until the coming of music that was hard enough (i.e. House) that it became popular (although cocaine and LSD were also common in early House culture).<br><br>In New York, the same story happened but with more <b>elements from Soul & Gospel</b>, called <b>Garage House </b>or <b>US Garage</b>. New York House DJ’s, such as the legendary <b>Larry Levan</b>, mixed more Ambient music with House, which shaped Garage House during its long-lasting evolution. Its roots can be traced back to the late seventies, even long before Chicago House. Garage House is named after the club in New York where it originated: the <b>Paradise Garage</b>.<br><br>Although House seemed like a sudden revolution, it really wasn’t. It was just another step in the ongoing evolution of <b>Disco-debauchery</b>, with Italo-Disco and Hi-NRG being the intermediate steps. The main difference with Disco however, was that House was here to stay. Chicago and Garage House never lost their appeal and today they remain floor fillers, because for many the original recipe still tastes the best.",

        "description": "Originally, Acid House was strongly tied with other Classic House. In fact it was not much more than Chicago or Garage House with the added distorted sound of the infamous <b>TB-303 bass synthesizer</b>. These early, isolated examples of Acid House were known as “<b>Jack Tracks</b>”, which was also the name for the first and most famous Acid House record label (Jack Trax). By <b>looping</b> a certain note and then <b>distorting</b> the resulting wave (by cutoff, resonance or envelop), the characteristic and <b>psychedelic</b> “<b>acid sound</b>” was created, which could be used for basslines, melodies, or synth stabs. The term acid is derived from the very first Acid House record: Acid Tracks. This sound became so popular in the entire world of Dance music, that Acid House soon was a well-established genre on its own. <br><br>In 1987 the first (affordable) <b>electronic samplers</b> arise, which become heavily used in the world of Rap and (Acid) House. Acid House starts to incorporate Rap elements (Proto Hip House) and becomes a <b>hyperactive and epileptic bricolage of samples</b>. This moment is the start of the Rave culture, which skyrocketed after the <b>Second Summer of Love</b> in <b>Ibiza</b> (also in <b>1987</b>) and became immortalized by the <b>yellow smiley</b> symbol.<br><br>But the paramount trademark of Acid House is a <b>severance with House’s Disco influences</b> and the corresponding gay and hipster subcultures. In Acid House, there is no longer a warm groove, no R&B feel, but harsh and distorted sounds onto a loud four-to-the-floor beat. All of the sudden, House becomes something even white British Post-Punk artists can relate to, being rough and revolutionary. Though these evolutions were incidental, the consequences were unimaginable.",

        "description": "The <b>European</b> version of Classic House incorporated <b>Rap and Techno elements </b>to create a one-size-fits-all genre that was both <b>extremely commercial and popular</b>: Eurodance. In Europe, it was simply called Dance, and later better known as “<b>the sound of the nineties</b>”. It must be noted that Eurodance is rather a large <b>collection of</b> different <b>subgenres</b> than a single well-defined one. The earliest subgenres are House influenced Rap songs known as <b>Hip House</b> (a good example of this is “Young Mc – Know How”) and side-projects of Techno producers within the world of House (such as Kevin Saunderson’s production of “Inner City - Big Fun”). These early “<b>Technodance</b>” songs evolved together with Hip House and Rap-influenced Acid House into the stereotypical <b>Eurohouse</b>, Eurodance’s primary exponent.<br><br>Almost all Eurohouse is composed in a formal, predictable structure consisting of three alternating parts: <b>male rap verses, female diva choruses </b>and a super <b>catchy</b> Techno/House <b>synth melody</b>. All of this on top of a continuous pumping and more <b>pronounced Chicago House beat</b>. Later, various offshoots such as Bubblegum Dance, Handbag House, Italo Dance, and Anthem House provided slight variations. But they were rather the evidence of a hype overdone and a sign of the <b>commercial greed</b> of background producers, often feuding about royalties and <b>plagiarism</b>. <br><br>But these negative aspects remain merely side notes next to Eurodance’s positive vibe: in the early and mid-nineties, during a period of high prosperity and at the dawn of the new millennium, the <b>hyperactive and euphoric</b> music of Eurodance was the herald of even better things to come for a youth that was already overwhelmed by its <b>messages of freedom, love, and pure bliss</b>.",

Deep House has an<b> endless appeal</b> by going back to the primary Roots of House: Philly Soul. Fusion instruments (Hammond organs, electric pianos) give Deep House a <b>funky, warm sound</b>, while Philly Soul and Garage House arrangements provide a <b>steady dance rhythm</b>. That’s why Deep House is sometimes referred to as Jazz House. The most typical characteristic of Deep House is a total <b>absence of climax and classic song structure</b>; the music is <b>one long mix</b> of groovy House beats. After Deep House, the closely related genre <b>Funky House</b> emerged; a more Funk than Soul oriented variant. Deep House forms the opposing pole of a polarized House universe: ambient and soulful versus hard and sharp, which has turned both sides into love-it-or-hate-it styles. Deep House's average tempo is <b>slightly slower</b> than Chicago’s (120bpm) and often features downtuned or <b>downsampled sounds</b>, which sound like they are heard underwater. As such, Deep House submerges the listener in the groovy waves of soulful House. It is not there to blast relentlessly impulses into the brain; it is there to party all night long without excesses.",

        "description": "A <b>faster</b>, more <b>driven</b> and more <b>ecstatic</b> version of Eurodance appeared on the Dance stage in 1995, and proved highly popular within <b>gay circles</b>. NRG means energy, and most suitably so: this is the “Go-Go of Dance”. A highly repetitive driven motif - like Techno with a bit of melody - goes on and on, driving the (gay) crowd bonkers. Hence Nu-NRG, the <b>Hi-NRG version of the nineties</b>, was born. In other words: (Nu-)NRG is the forth transmutation in a tremendous evolution of Disco-intensification (Disco → Hi-NRG = Eurodisco → House → Eurohouse → NRG = Nu-NRG). But this was not even the final stage.<br><br>Gradually, NRG becomes Hard NRG and <b>heavily modified wave form melodies</b> (often acid) and the use of <b>hoover</b> and other <b>Rave sounds</b> participate in the music. From innocent and energetic, NRG becomes <b>dark and pulsing</b>, like a quasar among genres. Hard NRG connects the world of House with that of Trance, as a crossroad for other genres. It helped House producers get acquainted with Trance, but in the late nineties, Hard NRG takes a step away from Trance into the final and most distant stage of Disco-intensification: (UK) Hard House. <br><br>Hard House is the ultimate bumper car music; the soundtrack of the fairground: flashing, <b>pounding, building up and breaking loose</b>. Hard House aka Retro House aka Stupid House aka Party House is characterized by <b>hard bass stabs, silly samples, hoovers, and a fast tempo</b> of 150bpm. Breakdowns are intensified, either by silence or drum rolls, and prelude harsh climaxes. Because the American Press uses Hard House as an umbrella label for any type of Hard Dance, the specific term “UK Hard House” is being reserved for this genre (a poor choice, considering the fact that Hard House is even more popular in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium)",

        "description": "French House started almost simultaneously with its sibling <b>Funk House</b> genres, Deep and Funky House, in the late eighties. It wasn’t until the late nineties though, that many French House producers broke through internationally. Being much less ambient and soulful than Deep House, French House was more attracted to the <b>futuristic visions of P-Funk</b>. But more important was Eurodisco, which had a lasting impact in <b>France</b> on Dance music thanks to the regional subgenre <b>Space-Disco</b>. Ever since Eurodisco arrived in France (around 1987), the build-up to French House was already tangible, but to people abroad the music felt revolutionary. This means <b>spacey Synthpop sounds</b>, a highly <b>danceable</b> nature, and “Electro” effects (such as <b>robotic filter and phaser melodies</b>; the trademark of French House). French House uses many references in song names or artwork to <b>science-fiction</b> and space. Funky House and French House share a great deal of overlapping. Around 2000, Funky House becomes more popular but both remain well liked among many. French House is another example of popular music’s continuous return to its own history, using the past to shape the future.",

Nothing may be too distracting or too explicit. Therefore melody or groovy basslines are almost non-existent. Sounds are often <b>compressed</b>, extreme <b>low or high frequencies cut off</b>. Experimental <b>minimalistic sounds (blips, cuts)</b> are more likely the core of the music instead of ambient sound effects. The result is a weird and <b>extremely repetitive</b> soft House rhythm on top of a <b>soft beat</b>. Sometimes it seems like the record has been stuck or the music hasn’t really begun yet. It’s definitely <b>experimental</b> music that requires a certain mental approach to adore. Minimal House has a large influence from Glitch, after all. The genre originated in Berlin, but afterwards <b>Amsterdam</b> becomes the epicenter. Just like Minimal Techno formed a strong backlash against the second wave of Rave, so is Minimal House actually a <b>backlash against the third wave of Rave</b>: Hardtrance.  With a fairly <b>low tempo</b> and a focus on subtle drops and sounds, it is clearly the inverse of chainsaw-booming Hardtrance.",

And much later (around 2010) the popular subgenre (Chicago) Juke shows that the scene is far from dead.

        "description": "In the first half of the new millennium, House was almost on life-support. The global conquest of Trance and Rock’s reclaim as the dominant popular music genre banished it into the shadows. Yet in the darkest of times, House turned the tables by redrafting its own definition. It became what is more commonly (though wrongfully) known as “<b>Electro</b>”, by merging Electroclash with Tech House and shaking off its characteristic warm, R&B based groove. Indeed, Electro House is <b>harsh and cold</b> in comparison, due to <b>dirty, distorted</b> but <b>basic sawtooth synth melodies</b> and a large focus on an <b>incoherent climax</b>. Said climax consists of a heavy bassline, that is intensified by postponing with a tiny bit of silence. This is known as a “<b>drop</b>”, a musical technique which got transferred in many other types of music, especially  Trapstep and Post-Dubstep. Electro House is also defined by <b>minimal use of percussion</b> and an average tempo of <b>130 bpm</b>.<br><br>However, Electro House can be used as an <b>umbrella term</b> as well for all House genres that are directly influenced by it. The biggest and most deviant (Moombahton and Glitch House) are mentioned separately on the Carta. Three other and more similar to early Electro House are included here. The first one, <b>Dutch House</b>, is closely related and rather a <b>second wave</b> of Electro House as both genres originated in the Netherlands. Starting in 2008, Dutch House aka “<b>Dirty Dutch</b>” or “<b>Bleephouse</b>” has high pitched synths, bleeping sounds, intricate percussion, and less focus on bass.<br><br>Around 2010, another Electro House subgenre arrives: <b>Big Room</b> (House). As one of the most despised genres by music connoisseurs, Big Room seldom finds it way into genealogies. With its <b>predictable maximum-gravity drops</b> and over-the-top <b>bombastic</b> Electro House anthems, critics define this style as extremely <b>shallow, monotonous and commercial</b>.  The immense popularity of typical Big Room festivals or parties proves that the genre – clearly <b>love-it-or-hate-it</b> – cannot be shuffled away.<br><br>And finally we have <b>Melbourne Bounce</b>: a niche-genre of Electro House with acid and Jumpstyle influences. All these genres (Electro House XL) belong to a family of Dance music <b>catered to the masses</b> that in more recent terms (regrettably) has been dubbed “<b>EDM</b>”.",

        "description": "In a time of music genre saturation, new genres are often invented by the unexpected fusion of two remote, distinctive genres. Moombahton is such an example: <b>(Dutch) Electro House meets Reggaetón</b>. Thus Moombahton is actually a form of House music, but <b>slowed down</b> and filled with Reggaetón sounds and rhythms, until it is barely recognizable as such. The name “Moombah” comes from the first conceived track. Moombahton is syncopated beat-heavy club music, with a <b>natural summer feeling</b>. Although the tempo is incredibly low in the world of EDM (100-110BPM), the party doesn’t slow down when Moombahton is around. Moombahton is loved for combining <b>heavy drops, hooks and beats</b> with <b>shrill synths</b> just like you find in Trapstep, Dubstep and Dutch House, but without taking itself seriously. It’s the funny sidekick of contemporary Dance. Songs are often very short, indicating that they are mostly used for a quick taste of the drop and main synth melody, after which another Moombahton track is unleashed. Moombahton’s House/Breakbeat/Jamaican melting pot often crosses over into Dubstep/Drum’n’Bass, creating the subgenre <b>Moombahcore</b>, but particulary into Trapstep, creating <b>Trapahton</b>. These subgenres are good examples of how Trapstep, Post-Dubstep, Electro House and Moombahton (the <b>“heavy drop”-genres</b>) have become so intertwined after 2013-14 that there is actually very few music that belongs strictly to one genre; the majority falls in between.

    "name": "TRANCE",
    "supergenre": true,
    "description": "Trance focuses on melody more than any other music genre. The name reveals its purpose: Trance is supposed to hypnotize and entrance the listener, to provide escapism. Therefore most Trance songs are much longer than other EDM songs and are often mixed and remixed. Long track lengths mirror that of Downtempo, but Trance is faster and with a pronounced four-to-the-floor beat. Trance is supposed to entrance the listener on the dance floor, not at home. It should take you on a journey of both mind and body. Yet however important melody may be, it should not disturb Trance’s harmonious holy trinity of beat, bass, and melody.<br><br>It is no coincidence that the rise of Trance coincides with the fall of Rave. Trance became a refuge for worn out ravers, in pursuit of tranquillity instead of noisy hyper-stimulation. Unknowingly, Trance is less related to drugs as House or Hardcore Techno (though some subgenres know how to restore the balance). Trance compensates a world of hedonism with a world of spirituality and deeper experience. At least that’s what it often claims to be. Whether or not Trance’s notion of self-indulgence (of which it’s sometimes accused) is true, its magnetism on different EDM communities worked well. Especially in its countries of origin, which form a geographical “Trance triangle”: Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.<br><br>Trance is recognizable by pronounced synth melodies which always form its core. All types of waveforms, modulations, and effects are discovered in the world of Trance. Synth melodies usually build up to theatrical climaxes: the crescendo. Crescendos are enhanced by arpeggios, rising pitches, or addition of layers (instruments, melodies). After the crescendo, melodies come down again with or without a breakdown, although a complete absence of melodic elements or synth stabs is quite rare because that way the entrancing might be lost. Just like modern Drum ‘n’ Bass, Trance needs computers to be produced. It favors digital technology over analog. This is why Trance is one of the youngest super-genres, and often produced with crystal clear sounds. Trance is not supposed to stop, its fast tempo (between 135 and 150bpm) eclipses even House and Techno and seamless mixes attempt to achieve one long Trance experience.<br><br>Trance used to be regarded as just a part of House or Techno, from which it originated. But over the course of time it developed into a fully-fledged super-genre, though a great deal of ignorance remains about its hierarchical status. This can be explained by the facts that most Trance DJ’s switch between different styles during their career and that the Trance community cares less about genre classification. Trance as a genre seems more unified than others, making it easy to be mistaken for a smaller style than it actually is. However, one should not underestimate the impact and influence of Trance. Many famous Dance songs, mistaken for House or Techno, are actually Trance. Rich, successful megastar DJ’s did not exist before Trance and EDM couldn’t maintain its momentum at the end of the nineties without Trance. At the beginning of the new millennium, Trance experienced massive mainstream success, which polarized its fan base into a commercial and alternative side. Lately, this dichotomy has ceased to be relevant as Trance itself is struggling to stay relevant. The future seems uncertain. But if you would like to travel with just music and no movement, Trance is still your best option.",

        "description": "In the centre of the great electronic dance storm of the late eighties and early nineties, House music started to take on many forms. As both Techno and Ambient music had their influence on Eurodance, a whirlwind of (mostly temporary) subgenres confused many music enthusiasts: Dream House, Handbag House, NRG, Anthem/Stadium House, Diva House, Ibiza House, etc. It is within this surge of styles that the earliest evolutions of Trance can also be found. Like House and Techno, Trance features a strong four-to-the-floor kick beat and a similar bassline but unlike both of them, <b>synthesizer melodies</b> absolutely <b>dominate</b> any other part of the music. Usually there is more than one melody, strongly intertwined with the synth bassline, hereby creating a <b>layered structure</b>. To facilitate the <b>hypnotic</b>, entrancing effect of the music, the beat and rhythm are <b>highly repetitive</b>, with as little variation as possible. The earliest forms of Trance started in <b>Germany</b>, where House/Techno DJ’s created the <b>plainest, purest</b> Trance <b>style</b>. Particularly Frankfurt and Berlin were important havens of “<b>Teutonic</b>” (=German) <b>Trance</b> aka Classic Trance.<br><br>Acid Trance forms the link between Acid House and Classic Trance; thus it forms the earliest type of Trance, but acid sounds occur everywhere within Trance and a separation of these genres is pointless. Classic Trance is a highly varied genre and difficult to outline compared to later Trance genres, but its identity lies in sheer <b>simplicity, serenity and harmony</b>: Classic Trance searches for an <b>enlightened state of consciousness</b> without forcing itself onto the listener.",

Balearic Trance builds further on the local genre of the eighties: <b>Balearic Beat</b>: a summer-infused, ambient type of Eurodisco.

Here, <b>spiritual</b> refugee <b>hippies</b> sought new forms of psychedelic music as House and Techno conquered the world and Acid Rock was no longer hip. When Trance was invented, it quickly became the preferred music of choice, lending itself perfectly to accompany hallucinogenic drug experiences. Almost every element of Goa Trance is based on <b>hallucinogenic drugs</b> and trip experiences, particularly tryptamines like magic mushrooms, LSD, salvia divinorum, and DMT.<br><br>But Goa was not just a refuge: it was the <b>destination</b> of a long and adventurous <b>hippie trail</b>, starting in Ibiza, towards Marrakech, then the<b> Middle East</b>, across Asia to Kathmandu, and then finally India. All kinds of musical influences were brought along this trail, such as melodies and instruments from the Middle East, Ibiza, Dream, and Ambient Trance, and <b>Indian Raga</b> music. With all these influences and the possibilities of fresh Trance, Goa Trance (often abbreviated to “Goa”) rapidly transformed into the most <b>complex, multi-layered</b> dance music ever invented: a tsunami of <b>psychedelic sound effects</b>, intricate melodies, and <b>hyperclean</b>, punctuated kick beats. Goa often uses more simultaneous tracks (multi-tracking) than any other music genre: it is the perfect soundtrack for a lightning-speed <b>transcendental journey</b> into the unconscious mind. Yet Goa is far more than a music genre; Regular Goa parties around the world keep the spirit of a thriving subculture alive. Special Goa <b>deco teams</b> (who dress up parties with psychedelic <b>fluorescent artwork</b>) and multicultural markets reincarnate the sixties message of peace, love and <b>open-mindedness</b> in an entirely different sound and look.<br><br>Although Goa Trance has stayed its entire lifespan underground, it is truly a <b>massive genre</b>, popular in the most diverse range of countries (Israel, Brazil, India, Finland, Germany...) and with a plethora of well-established subgenres: <b>Nitzhonot</b> (Israeli fusion with Epic Trance), <b>Full-On</b> (heavily layered and energetic), <b>Suomisaundi</b> (Finnish rave-like minimal Goa), <b>Dark Psy</b> (scary bad trip Goa), <b>Morning Trance</b> (to be played outdoors at sunrise), <b>Old Skool Goa-Trance</b> and even more.",

The House version is very, <b>very Trancelike</b> and the Trance version is strongly influenced by House. Furthermore, both genres have experienced a multi-wave evolution throughout their history and borrowed each others names, confusing even the more seasoned EDM-experts. Despite certain beliefs, they are not the same, and being both large and long-lasting genres, it is recommended treating them as such.<br><br>The word “Progressive” in Progressive House and Trance points to a <b>progress of chords</b> within the music: the song gradually evolves over the course of time. Progressive Trance appears after and is influenced by (the second wave of) Progressive House. Between mainstream, radio-edited Ibiza/Dream Trance and underground, uncompromising Psytrance, there was need for a flexible middle ground. Inspired by the success and formula of Deep House, Trance evolves into <b>much longer songs</b> (thus easier to mix) with <b>extended build-ups, chords and breakdowns</b>. With an average tempo lower than most Trance (around 130bpm) and heavy use of reverb, delay and washing sounds, Progressive Trance aims at a serious sound. Slightly heavy and gloomy and more <b>subtle</b> in its <b>approach of melody</b> (usually in a minor key), the genre is perhaps one of the most effective Trance genres to well up images from another reality. <br><br>Just like Progressive House, the genre has no boundaries edged in stone. There is much music that falls somewhere between Progressive and something else, such as Tech House, Tech Trance, Hardtrance, or whatnot.

        "description": "When the great Eurodance craze was finally about to lay down (around 1997), a new hit chart oriented Dance music took its place. Dream Trance, Ibiza Trance & Classic Trance remixes by big Trance Producers and pioneering Uplifting Trance tracks start to show up sporadically in the second half of the nineties on mainstream radio and hit charts. Taking cues from this new and exciting music,<b> Eurohouse transformed </b>into Eurotrance. Vocal Trance is a specific and very popular type of Eurotrance with <b>female verses</b> and <b>melancholic</b> or <b>emotional choruses</b>. <br><br>Eurotrance and particularly Vocal Trance have a clear <b>radio-friendly</b> orientation: songs are edited singles, not long mix tracks. Therefore, Vocal Trance is more <b>structured</b>, both in harmony and melody, than any other form of Trance, and most similar to Pop music, giving it its alias: <b>Poptrance</b>. The genre became most popular in the same countries where Eurohouse was: Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, and the UK. <br><br>Though rather small and modestly influential, Vocal Trance tremendously helped spread Trance to a much greater audience. Together with Uplifting Trance, Vocal Trance forms <b>“commercial” Trance</b>, which lost popularity after 2002 in favor of more “underground” types of Trance: Tech, Hard, and Progressive. This loss can partially be explained by an exuberant abundance of commercial trance, which left adversaries to choke in their loathing. But the merit of commercial Trance cannot be swooped under the rug: bringing a <b>massive</b> amount of Dance-crazed people together in an <b>ecstatic environment</b> without drug excesses or hassle reports.",

This is not uncontrolled ecstasy tearing down the house like many previous Dance genres; Epic Trance is a new kind of sensation:<b> euphoric bliss</b> symbolized by a mass of waving hands, daytime venues and lasers.

    "name": "DOWNTEMPO",
    "supergenre": true,
    "description": "Downtempo is a collection of primarily electronic music with an average tempo lower than usual (below 110 bpm), hence its name. Because of such a low tempo, the music is generally not meant for dancing and seldom live performed. Downtempo is music to listen to in a natural (read: non-musical) environment. Downtempo music is often featured in film soundtracks, on albums for home listening, in public places, or… at the university. Early Downtempo evolved out of academic experiments with the first electronic music instruments. This can even be traced back to the 1920s, when the very first electronic sound was produced, thanks to Léon Theremin and his homonymous instrument. To these researchers, Downtempo was not particularly slow. Only many decades later, after the arrival of much faster electronic dance genres, was the term “Downtempo” applied to this music. Sometimes Downtempo is simply referred to as “Electronic” as opposed to (Electronic) Dance (Music).<br><br>Downtempo puts greater emphasis on sounds and sound experimentation than most super-genres. The whole history of Downtempo has been about exploring and discovering new techniques and sounds, and gently expanding on its discoveries. Downtempo does not choose between acoustic or electronic, it includes whatever it can to produce the perfect sound.<br><br>The most important aspect of Downtempo however, is a radically different approach on music in general. Instead of working with (serial) song structure, most songs are non-serial: they evolve slowly and gradually by repetition instead of structured patterns. Within this seamlessly endless repetition, the mind is being taken on a transcendental journey. With no pattern, no point of orientation, there is no more song, only music. Downtempo asks questions about what music is, instead of being an answer like other genres. The unique classical works of Claude Débussy have been an important influence on much of Downtempo’s music, but unconventional world musicians experimenting with structure and sound left their mark as well.<br><br>“Ambient”, from the Latin “ambire” or “to surround”, is a surrounding music genre emerging in the seventies that was so influential to other (electronic) music that it became a pars pro toto for the whole group of Downtempo genres. Because once again, Ambient raises an important question: should music be noticeable and autonomous or a barely indistinguishable and integrated part of everyday life?<br><br>Downtempo has a complex and unique genealogy. The overall genre structure is very linear due to a slow and extensive evolution, but there are no less than five music groups discernable. Groups with significant autonomy, but also a high degree of overlapping due to Downtempo’s experimental nature:<br><br>1.&nbsp The Electronic Avant-Garde: responsible for laying the foundations of all electronic music and thus almost half of all popular music genres. This includes Musique Concrète, Minimalism, and their later subgenres: Sound Collage and Neo-Minimalism.<br>2.&nbsp The large family of Easy-Listening, including Lounge: sometimes considered a super-genre on its own. Easy-Listening is a term reserved for gentle background music with a variety of origins, mostly exotic or Jazzy.<br>3.&nbsp Progressive Electronic: the interesting crossroads between Progressive Rock and electronic music at a time where genre was meaningless and eventually leading to Ambient, the principal Downtempo genre.<br>4.&nbsp Ambient Dance: the combination of Ambient with any other EDM genre such as: Ambient Techno, Ambient Breakbeat, Ambient House and so on. Sometimes referred to as Chill-Out or Downbeat, although the former is confusingly also used for Loungetronica.<br>5.&nbsp Synth: the collection of music that is entirely or dominantly synthesizer based, with pronounced synth melodies and basslines, but also with a high degree of rhythm and percussion compared to Electronic Avant-Garde or Progressive Electronic.",

        "description": "Lounge is the term for background music in the fifties and sixties at bars, social places, and of course <b>hotel lounges</b>. It’s music to make people comfortable and relaxed <b>without drawing too much attention</b> to itself. The first wave of Lounge (aka pure or acoustic Lounge) is a loose collection of related subgenres, often based on the template of Swing: <b>Space Age Pop</b> (the principal Lounge genre, named after the space age aka the fifties and with many Latin Jazz influences), <b>Exotica</b> (similar, but with more Hawaiian, Caribbean, or Oceanian influences), Mambo, Latin Jazz, and Bossa Nova. All these genres are connected by their<b> warm, exotic, and cozy feel</b>. Combined with Muzak and New Age, Lounge is also known as Easy-Listening, though the use of this term as a genre is contested. The difference between Spage Age Pop and Exotica is minimal. Both genres stir up a picture of another place: an <b>exotic</b> (retro) <b>dreamworld</b> to take the listener on <b>holiday</b> while relaxing.<br><br>In the sixties, Lounge gets annihilated by the success of Rock and it would take three decades to get back on its feet. Bands Saint Etienne, Combustible Edison, and Pizzicato Five <b>revived</b> acoustic Lounge <b>in the nineties</b>, but their success was little compared to the real second wave of Lounge taking place at the same time. In this wave, Jazz was no longer used but replaced by <b>soft, slow, electronic music</b> (especially Ambient was a big influence) and the word “Lounge” got a new meaning. <b>Electronic Lounge or Loungetronica</b> as it is called, is not listed as a separate genre but divided on the Carta into its distinctive subgenres: Nu-Jazz, Trip Hop, Broken Beats, Ambient House, and Jazzstep. The abundant Lounge <b>compilation albums</b> available feature a variety of these genres, and often include songs that cross over to one of the other genres. This has created the illusion that electronic Lounge is a real separate genre. Though when it comes to conveying these otherwise hard-to-find tracks into your living room, the end justifies the means.",

Since its invention, it has been frequently used as background music for <b>elevators, airports, swimming pools, shopping malls</b> or any other public place where people might get uncomfortable.

Though Muzak itself already existed since the twenties as so called “<b>Furniture Music</b>”, it wasn’t until the early sixties that it broke through. The name Muzak came actually from a company specialized in making taped background music, which they sold to public venues in the sixties and particularly to companies as a <b>tool to motivate their workforce</b>. Early Muzak was strongly influenced by the works of French composer <b>Erik Satie</b>, who inspired the whole of avant-garde Downtempo with his repetitive and minimal arrangements or piano works. By the early sixties, Muzak becomes also popular outside these constrained spheres. <br><br>The difference between the early <b>Easy-Listening</b> genres - Muzak and Lounge - is that Lounge is supposed to be intimate, warm and moody (to enhance a certain setting) where Muzak is extremely <b>functional</b>.

        "description": "The term “Electronica” was given in the early nineties to a collection of album and single oriented EDM genres with high popularity (Big Beat, IDM, Ambient Breaks and Ambient House) by the American press. Unfortunately, this collection was more artificial than anything else, and became soon a despised genre name by music connoisseurs. It is however also used, slightly more appropriate, for one of the earliest electronic genres: Synth.<br><br> At the end of the sixties, a <b>single affordable electronic music instrument</b> was suddenly released on the market that was able to do anything!

The possibilities of the first synthesizers were not endless however, and some presets were more liked than others. This fact combined with the <b>eagerness of unknown DIY-composers </b>resulted in an avalanche of similar electronic tunes: <b>strong, catchy melodies</b> (often four simple chords), alternated by <b>spacey sound effects</b> (e.g. flying saucers) and accompanied by <b>synth strings</b> or <b>moody bass chords</b>, either without beat or with the echoing thunder of built-in drum computers. <br><br>In the eighties, this so called “Electronica” (better known as synthesizer music or simply Synth) saw a small revival as the bass-driven and hollow sounding subgenre <b>Darksynth or Horrorsynth</b>, the soundtrack for all neon-filled sci-fi and technology horror films. Most of Synth was part of the so called subgenre “<b>Spacesynth</b>”: music for science fiction films or filled with space-like sounds. Synth became the favorite music for almost any <b>late seventies and early eighties television and film theme</b>, as it was a fairly new and unexpected sound that presented a challenge to be used for anything else.",

        "description": "Instead of the formal synthesizer music of Synth, some artists returned <b>to the roots of the Minimalists</b> and their sound experiments. Even with basic, commercial synthesizers it was still possible to create something truly experimental, but the genre was actually an accident involving an acoustic instrument: Brian Eno coincidentally slowed down the arpeggio of a harp to the point of dissolution. And thus Ambient was born. The concept this time was different than in the old days: the music should no longer be an autonomous element, but an <b>inseparable part of the environment</b>. This was done by creating the most <b>subtle, barely audible sounds</b> possible with a very <b>natural</b> sound. The end result was a <b>collage</b> of environmental sounds, <b>blending</b> in <b>with the surroundings</b> of the listener. Contrary to Muzak or Lounge, this was not music for public places, but for the listener’s own personal interior - <b>for private places</b> - so one could completely space out. Artists from various backgrounds, such as Progressive Rock bands Yes and Genesis, as well as highly innovative soloists were attracted to the idea of <b>music as form, music as space</b>, and not as furniture or something concrete.<br><br>Ambient has <b>extensive songs</b> that are arguably <b>the most progressive and impressionist</b> of all music genres; very slowly and gradually the music changes in time while subtly and vaguely presenting images from another reality, like Ravel's “Bolero”. Ambient, Synth/Electronica, experimental New Age and more electronic types of Prog Rock share a great deal of overlapping. The philosophical concepts of these “<b>Progressive Electronic</b>” genres could be applied to many other ones as well, ranking them high as influential styles. In Germany, a very influential style of Ambient, known as the <b>Berlin School</b>, drew cues from Kraftwerk and laid the foundations for many Downtempo and Synthpop to come.",

On the other hand there was the rise of unprecedented heavy, macho music such as Hard Rock and Heavy Metal. Hereby, record stores saw a steady increase in <b>demand in the opposite genre</b>.

Therefore it can please Rock/Pop and Electronic oriented fans at the same time. Though most New Age is <b>instrumental, soothing voices</b> are not uncommon. The overall tempo is very low (50-60 bpm) and transitions occur gradually and smooth. New Age caresses the mind with trembling <b>timbres</b> and stimulates the body with an <b>inner rhythm</b>.The whole purpose of the music is to relax, which is why some have mockingly called it “<b>Hot Tub music</b>”.

In these zones, dancefloor refugees usually hung out in the early hours to deal with <b>XTC’s harsh comedown effects</b>: the detrimented mind in search for sensation and the hyperfatigued body aching but unable to rest. Ambient House brought solace as musical <b>synesthesia</b>: gentle, tactile sounds sensually touching the mind and mesmerizing melodies massaging mashed muscles, while a <b>steady (subordinate) House beat</b> provides the basic energy to sustain just a little while longer (though sometimes breakbeats are added). During the nineties, Chill-Out rapidly reached a fan base outside its druggy proving grounds, and received a wider definition encompassing <b>all electronic easy-listening music</b> (such as Nu Jazz, Trip hop, Broken Beats, Electronic New Age, Nu Lounge…).",

Ambient Breaks differs from Trip Hop (albeit sometimes minimally) as it is not Hip Hop music; it is the work of electronic music producers using various samples instead of a movement bridging remote subcultures into one.<br><br>When Trip Hop arrived in the US (specifically <b>New York</b>), <b>conceptual</b> artists got inspired by the sound but worked the other way around: they laid <b>multiple layers of echoing ambient sounds </b>on top of each other (influenced by <b>Dub</b>) and then added a breakbeat. These soundscapes are often <b>eclectic noisescapes: dark, experimental</b>, and drawing from different genres to create some sort of deep mysterious force. Illbient (= <b>Ill Ambient</b>, in its slang meaning: “this beat is ill”) is not drug music as one might suspect, but an <b>artsy, contemplative soundtrack</b> for an unwritten creepy or deeply psychological film.",

        "description": "Glitch is another example of the fact that anything can be music and probably almost any genre already exists. Inspired by the <b>cracking and skittering sound of broken compact discs</b> (“CD-glitches”), some DJ’s and sound producers in Germany and the UK went ahead to compose entire songs of <b>faults</b>, as if the songs were <b>broken</b>. Alongside glitches, often used techniques involve addition of the well-known broken disc “<b>clicking sound</b>” and <b>skipping</b> part of the track (laser jumping), which is simply referred to as “<b>cuts</b>”. Hence Glitch’s synonym name: Clicks ‘n’ Cuts. Although compact discs became less and less the staple of the music industry, the concept of a <b>collage of unexpected error noises </b>remained a strong influence on electronic music and could be seen as the <b>third</b> and arguably most real, most concrete<b> wave of Musique Concrète</b>. Glitch is more than just an out-of-the-box experiment – the genre symbolizes<b> the art of failure</b>, and raises philosophical questions about whether a song should be controlled and predetermined. The corresponding artwork is highly conceptual and almost an <b>art exhibition</b> on its own, further strengthening Glitch’s metaphysical dimension. Pure Glitch is a lesser familiar genre, but its fusions with other super-genres (Glitch Hop, Glitch House) are more common.",

        "description": "One of the final chapters in the history of Downtempo music marks a return to <b>heavy experimentation</b>, after an era of more or less predictable, popular Ambient Dance. As always inspired by the revered minimalists, a new wave of minimalists emerged, more extreme than before. The radical concept this time was to <b>create silence instead of music</b> (without actually creating silence, which wouldn’t present any challenge). In lengthy songs, long passages of silences are being highlighted by very quiet sounds. Not to break formality, but to enhance the <b>contrast</b> by <b>heavily manipulated sounds </b>(<b>digitally</b> this time) that would leap out of the silent abyss and catch the listener unaware. These can be <b>ambient sounds</b>, like Steve Roden’s experiments with folding paper, or something uncanny. Just like light cannot exist without shadows, so enable these sounds the awareness of silence. The combination of Lowercase’s song names with their track lengths exposes its radical concept, like “The Ant Moves the […] Carcass a Little Closer”, which lasts over 25 minutes. What we have here then, is without a doubt <b>the least prominent</b> of all music genres, and fittingly coined “Lowercase” (which actually shouldn’t be capitalized, something Glitch artists often do as well). Many Lowercase artists also create Glitch music and like to switch between styles to stay fresh and unexpected. Lowercase is music that is there and isn’t: it exists <b>momentarily</b>, illustrating the almost century-long struggle of electronic composers to make music a <b>living thing</b>.",

    "supergenre": true,
    "description": "Industrial is a genre in between Rock and Electronic music. It evolved out of the German post-war underground scene in the seventies, and has been experimental and obscure ever since. Gothic music, following out of “Post-Punk Depression”, shares many characteristics with Industrial and both subcultures have become intertwined into a state of Siamese twins. Author John Savage outlines five different aspects of Industrial music that show a great deal of insight into this rather secluded genre: organizational autonomy, access to info, use of synth and anti-music, extra-musical elements, and shock tactics.<br><br>The first one - organizational autonomy - can be traced back to the roots of the genre’s name: Industrial comes from Industrial Records, the first Industrial record company and more an extreme experiment than a real enterprise. The name however is no coincidence: early Industrial criticizes contemporary art by going either backwards (dark retro/industrial age) or forwards (dark cyber/futurism). Musical references to factory and industrial life (noise, machines) strengthen Industrial’s name. Industrial however does not follow any rules but likes to create the illusion of a heavily organized machine, with visual references to totalitarian regimes such as strong logos, artwork in black-red-white, and band names that are conceived as unstoppable movements on their own. Special fashion subcultures that combine “industrial” looks with either futuristic or retro aesthetics such as “Steampunk” or “Cyberpunk”, enrich modern Industrial subculture, and are sometimes mistaken for music genres.<br><br>Industrial is also keen on introducing synth and anti-music (read: noise) into its songs to create the atmosphere of retro-futurism or even more appropriately “techno-paranoia”, reminiscent of American novelist William S. Burroughs. The song structure of Rock gets combined with the sound effects and instrumentation of electronic music, specifically Downtempo, Techno, and Trance. Industrial has a slower, hypnotizing tempo compared to Rock and a pronounced, perfectly regular (almost in a military fashion) rhythm that pounds throughout most Industrial tracks. This has led to the implementation of the word “Techno” on many Industrial genres, such as “Technoid”, “Dark Techno”, “Cybertechno”, and so on. But Industrial is nothing like Techno: there is no groove or soul within, only a dark, pulsing force that is torn and tortured by its own resourceful consciousness.<br><br>The forth aspect of Industrial, extra-musical elements, concerns visual art and fashion, but most importantly performance art. Industrial culture is known for its extravagant music concerts. The earliest music shows in the seventies already explored the outer limits of what is morally acceptable on stage and then leapt far and wide over these limits. Not only on stage but also in cover art and lyrics, shock tactics are being used by Industrial: references to fascism and Nazism, torture, self-mutilation, deviant sex, and psychotic, disturbing imagery or voices, all intensified by the dark and heavy sound of Electronic Rock. But Industrial is anything but fascist; the music holds a mirror to those who wrongfully believe so and teaches how people are easily manipulated by media and the visual. Industrial is a philosophical meta-genre, which is why it values access to info.<br><br>Industrial has always believed that music is unable to change the world. Yet it tries nevertheless, resulting in a schizophrenic identity of aggression/noise versus melancholy/depression.  This ironic paradox explains many of its characteristics and why few understand and appreciate the music. But more remarkably, is what makes Industrial unique among super-genres: the fact that it has managed to survive all this time while staying practically completely underground (the odd Industrial Rock superstars excluded). The reason is a steel subculture: strong and durable and more important than a technical common ground. Indeed, when one listens to Noise Music or Early Industrial and compares this to Futurepop, the difference can hardly be larger. But as long as there is something repulsive about contemporary society, Industrial, regardless of style, has a reason to exist.",

        "description": "In the period ensuing World War II, German culture and especially music had been looking for a <b>new identity</b>. Determined to create the most original, innovative and unique music ever invented, a handful of German bands got to work, drawing influences from almost equally experimental <b>Progressive Rock</b> groups. When the <b>first commercial synthesizers </b>were released, they were the vanguard to exploit them in any way imaginable and thus releasing electronic music onto the masses. Typically German, the result was Prog Rock, but with electronic influences and based on a <b>repetitive and mechanical</b> sound called “<b>Motorik</b>”. Motorik gave Krautrock a <b>sterile</b> sound due to a complete absence of acoustic elements. By using this motorik, Krautrock introduced a <b>slow song progression </b>reminiscent of Minimalism and avant-garde Downtempo, instead of traditional Rock structures and solos. <b>Influences from Psychedelia</b> were also welcomed by German bands, with which they shared a love for experimentation. Krautrock is actually a derogatory term by the British Press. In Germany, Krautrock’s <b>lengthy “Electro-Psy-Prog-Rock”</b> songs were more appropriately known at the time as <b>Cosmic</b> (Kosmischen) <b>Rock</b>. With their <b>mythological</b> and <b>cryptic</b> band <b>names</b>, Krautrock bands formed the perfect <b>prelude for Space Rock</b>, which finally evolved into Stoner Rock.<br><br>One band however, chose a far more radical path than others by abandoning all Rock influences. <b>Kraftwerk</b> made the first completely electronic music that had recognizable structure, melody, and bass. With Kraftwerk as arguably the <b>most revolutionary popular music artist</b> of all time, Krautrock is one of the most <b>influential</b> genres, bridging the gap between Rock and Dance.",

        "description": "Reminiscent of Karlheinz Stockhausen’s epic “Gesang Der Jünglinge”, Dark Industrial can deliver <b>lengthy compositions</b> (some over 20 minutes long). It’s nigh impossible to separate Dark Industrial from related genres Dark Ambient (aka <b>Isolationism</b>) and<b> Ambient Industrial</b> as they all consist of the same eerie atmosphere; sometimes beautiful but often downright <b>frightening and disturbing</b>. A minimal soundscape of the past resurrected with typical industrial sound effects and techniques, in which <b>haunting and gloomy</b> sounds (often repetitive in nature) form the foreground. In the background one regularly finds a stream of<b> heavily distorted noise</b>. The difference with Early Industrial lies in a less noisy/experimental approach and a more ambient/<b>atmospheric</b> one. Dark Ambient is your typical graveyard ruin by night soundtrack, or the sound of a monochrome forest echoing through a picture from the past. It’s no surprise that this genre is often used in <b>horror films or scary game soundtracks</b>. Out of Dark Ambient an important subgenre in the late eighties arises: <b>Ethereal (Dark)wave</b> or <b>Neoclassical Wave</b>. Ethereal Wave becomes a big thing in France, where spooky French hushes or weeping voices are added on top of <b>melodramatic classical music </b>infused with Dark Ambient elements.  The result is the ultimate Gothic music and a further strengthening of its relationship with Industrial.",

        "description": "A wall of <b>electronically amplified</b> Hard Rock / Metal riffs (to the <b>maximum</b>) blows you away with angry <b>protesting singers</b> that were born to be enemy of the state. This is Industrial Rock/Metal: a music style that’s so <b>loud and uncompromising</b> in its own nature that there actually is no difference between Industrial Rock and Metal (though some would disagree), and that makes you realize that Hard Rock really isn’t that hard.  The fusion of Rock and Industrial was bound to happen, as both always were closely related to each other via Krautrock.<br><br>The first wave of Industrial Metal bands such as Ministry and Godflesh, was more oriented towards Rock than electronic music, and featured <b>ultraheavy droning riffs</b> alongside an affinity towards chaos/noise. A number of later bands, who also focused on the <b>theatrics</b> of their performance and visual aesthetics (costumes, video clips, <b>extravagant</b> shows) changed that sound. Industrial Metal (aka <b>Aggro-Industrial</b>) evolved into a more <b>electronic and driven sound</b>, with use of <b>sequencers</b> and more synth. In Germany, a specific movement known as the <b>Neue Deutsche Härte</b> (New German Hardness) emerged with a more stoic appearance and polished production (though still equally as loud as other Industrial Rock). These bands were responsible for familiarizing Industrial to a larger audience, yet this never seduced the artists of walking down a path of predictability and political correctness. When this new kind of music broke through, it created a small shockwave, catapulting the obscure and alternative Industrial scene into <b>mainstream</b> with major label superstars filling arenas. Because lots of people seemed to crave for the heaviest music possible but with that extra <b>touch of synth</b>.",

        "description": "The <b>second wave of industrial</b> was quite different from the first one: instead of a revolutionary movement, it was going-out music for the deep underground industrial <b>nightlife</b>. This was the first true <b>Industrial Dance</b>, though it is more commonly known as “Aggreppo” (<b>Aggressive Pop</b>). Electro-Industrial mixed all Industrial genres onto an electronic <b>pounding beat</b>, which resulted in a sort of “Dark Anthem Techno” with both <b>haunting female vocals</b> and <b>sinister whispering or mumbling male vocals</b>. Electro-Industrial makes it seem as if the dancefloor is controlled by lust-craving vampires and intimidating inquisitors. <b>Sado-masochism, torture, bondage </b>and pornography are in fact common themes of Electro-Industrial. <b>Deeper, darker, and more layered</b> than before, Electro-Industrial channels an aura of <b>dominance and power</b>, the universal denominator of Aggreppo. Electro Industrial also started Industrial’s common theme of “<b>Futurism Noir</b>” or dark sci-fi. A theme referred to by the recurring prefix “cyber”, such as Aggreppo’s alias: <b>Cybertechno</b>.<br><br>Some artists take the <b>ruthlessness</b> of the music to the extreme and combine this with <b>atonal vocals</b> and the pulsing rhythm of EBM. This has led in the mid-nineties to a popular subgenre: <b>Aggrotech</b> (aka <b>Terror EBM or Hellektro</b>). Aggrotech is a bold and traumatizing combination of EBM and Aggreppo with <b>sharper and abrasive sounds</b>. Aggrotech is arguably one of the most <b>extreme</b> music genres and a prime example of Industrial’s (successful) ambition to create anti-music.",

        "description": "Futurepop can be seen as a subgenre of Electro-Industrial or as an evolution of it (i.e. something new). The latter is being preferred here. Although it is one of the smallest and least known genres on the Carta, Futurepop illustrates once again an interesting <b>link between Industrial and Trance</b>. This has happened before, when hard EBM beats found their way into the earliest forms of Goa Trance. Futurepop is as much Pop as Aggreppo is Pop, meaning it is <b>barely</b> true <b>Pop</b> at all. It is however a much <b>cleaner, more produced type of Electro-Industrial</b>, with <b>no distortions</b>, scary vocals, or obscene themes. This genre focuses on <b>dark but beautiful melancholic synth melodies</b> and <b>powerful synth basslines</b>, which can recollect and crossover to (dark) Trance (though regularly at a lower bpm). Futurepop can mirror a lot of Darkwave because the latter is Gothic Synthpop, where the former actually is <b>Industrial Synthpop</b>. Futurepop is the perfect soundtrack for anything <b>sci-fi or futuristic</b>: <b>completely electronic</b> and dark, but <b>crystal clea</b>r. This is not instrumental music like Trance; equally <b>melancholic vocals</b> about bombastic, biblical topics (future oriented) mark this genre as a highly <b>thematic</b> one.",
